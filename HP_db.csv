26,MCGONAGALL," Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?",1,female
27,MCGONAGALL, And the boy?,1,female
28,MCGONAGALL, Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?,1,female
29,MCGONAGALL," Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are",1,female
30,MCGONAGALL, This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.,1,female
31,MCGONAGALL," Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now, while you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup",1,female
32,MCGONAGALL, The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. {leaves},1,female
33,MCGONAGALL, We're ready for you now.,1,female
34,MCGONAGALL," All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbldedore would like to say a few words.",1,female
35,MCGONAGALL," When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.",1,female
36,MCGONAGALL, Draco Malfoy.,1,female
37,MCGONAGALL, Susan Bones.,1,female
38,MCGONAGALL, Ronald Weasley.,1,female
39,MCGONAGALL, Harry Potter.,1,female
40,MCGONAGALL," {dings on a cup} Your attention, please.",1,female
41,MCGONAGALL," Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, maybe one of you would be on time.",1,female
42,MCGONAGALL, Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.,1,female
43,MCGONAGALL, {appears quickly} Harry Potter? Follow me. {Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons laugh.},1,female
44,MCGONAGALL," Excuse me, excuse me, Professor Quirrell. Could I borrow Wood for a moment?",1,female
45,MCGONAGALL," Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!",1,female
46,MCGONAGALL," Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!",1,female
47,MCGONAGALL, Ms. Granger?,1,female
48,MCGONAGALL," Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. {Harry looks at Snape's leg...which has a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.} I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part, Ms. Granger. 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points...will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck. {Snape and McGonagall exit.}",1,female
49,MCGONAGALL, {Giggles happily},1,female
50,MCGONAGALL, Good evening.,1,female
51,MCGONAGALL," Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.",1,female
52,MCGONAGALL," Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.",1,female
53,MCGONAGALL," No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.",1,female
54,MCGONAGALL, I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.,1,female
55,MCGONAGALL, {shocked} How do you know,1,female
56,MCGONAGALL," I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. {They leave.}",1,female
141,PETUNIA, Up. Get up. {Knocks} {sighs} Now! {Smacks door of closet which is the boys bedroom},1,female
142,PETUNIA," Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!",1,female
143,PETUNIA," Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.",1,female
144,PETUNIA, I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.,1,female
145,PETUNIA," Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, Pumpkin?",1,female
146,PETUNIA, This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.,1,female
147,PETUNIA, {Sees him} AHH!,1,female
148,PETUNIA, My darling boy! How did you get in there?!,1,female
149,PETUNIA, It's all right. It's all right.,1,female
150,PETUNIA," Have a lovely day at the office, dear.",1,female
151,PETUNIA, Ooh.,1,female
152,PETUNIA," Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you.",1,female
153,PETUNIA, We had to tell him something.,1,female
561,HERMIONE, Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.,1,female
562,HERMIONE," Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.",1,female
563,HERMIONE," Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?",1,female
564,HERMIONE," Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}",1,female
565,HERMIONE," Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}",1,female
566,HERMIONE, Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?,1,female
567,HERMIONE, Eugh.,1,female
568,HERMIONE," I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something.",1,female
569,HERMIONE, Up. Up. Up. Up.,1,female
570,HERMIONE," Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. {Harry flies off.} What an idiot.",1,female
571,HERMIONE, You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.,1,female
572,HERMIONE, {Gasps.},1,female
573,HERMIONE," The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}",1,female
574,HERMIONE, We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.,1,female
575,HERMIONE," Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}",1,female
576,HERMIONE," Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.",1,female
577,HERMIONE, Filch is gone.,1,female
578,HERMIONE, It was locked.,1,female
579,HERMIONE," You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?",1,female
580,HERMIONE, It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.,1,female
581,HERMIONE," That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}",1,female
582,HERMIONE," Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.",1,female
583,HERMIONE, {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.},1,female
584,HERMIONE, Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.},1,female
585,HERMIONE, Ahhh! Help!,1,female
586,HERMIONE, Swish and flick!,1,female
587,HERMIONE, Is it...dead?,1,female
588,HERMIONE," It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}",1,female
589,HERMIONE, I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.,1,female
590,HERMIONE," Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.",1,female
591,HERMIONE, Blood?,1,female
592,HERMIONE, But why would anyone go near that dog?,1,female
593,HERMIONE, So you're saying...,1,female
594,HERMIONE," Bit early for mail, isn't it?",1,female
595,HERMIONE, It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!,1,female
596,HERMIONE, Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.},1,female
597,HERMIONE, Lacarnum Inflamarae.,1,female
598,HERMIONE, Whoo-hoo!,1,female
599,HERMIONE, That thing has a name?,1,female
600,HERMIONE," Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.",1,female
601,HERMIONE, I don't know.,1,female
602,HERMIONE, That's totally barbaric!,1,female
603,HERMIONE, See you haven't.,1,female
604,HERMIONE," Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.",1,female
605,HERMIONE, Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.},1,female
606,HERMIONE, I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.,1,female
607,HERMIONE," {glares} Of course! Here it is! ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!""",1,female
608,HERMIONE," Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.""",1,female
609,HERMIONE, It means you'll never die.,1,female
610,HERMIONE," ""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!",1,female
611,HERMIONE," {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.",1,female
612,HERMIONE, Is that...a dragon?,1,female
613,HERMIONE," Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.",1,female
614,HERMIONE, Harry!,1,female
615,HERMIONE," You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?",1,female
616,HERMIONE, Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?,1,female
617,HERMIONE," I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.",1,female
618,HERMIONE, It's happened before.,1,female
619,HERMIONE, What is it?,1,female
620,HERMIONE, And with Dumbledore gone,1,female
621,HERMIONE, Uh...we were just...,1,female
622,HERMIONE, Now what do we do?,1,female
623,HERMIONE," Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus.",1,female
624,HERMIONE, Sorry.,1,female
625,HERMIONE, Ow! You stood on my foot!,1,female
626,HERMIONE, Alohomora.,1,female
627,HERMIONE, The harp. It stopped playing.,1,female
628,HERMIONE," Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.",1,female
629,HERMIONE, Are you okay?,1,female
630,HERMIONE," He's not relaxing, is he?",1,female
631,HERMIONE, We've got to do something!,1,female
632,HERMIONE, What is that?,1,female
633,HERMIONE, Curious. I've never seen birds like these.,1,female
634,HERMIONE, What's this all about?,1,female
635,HERMIONE, Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!,1,female
636,HERMIONE," What's wrong, Harry?",1,female
637,HERMIONE, I don't like this. I don't like this at all.,1,female
638,HERMIONE, Now what do we do?,1,female
639,HERMIONE, What happens now?,1,female
640,HERMIONE," Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?",1,female
641,HERMIONE, What is it?,1,female
642,HERMIONE," No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!",1,female
643,HERMIONE," You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.",1,female
644,HERMIONE," {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.",1,female
645,HERMIONE, {smile} Never better.,1,female
646,HERMIONE, We're tied with Slytherin!,1,female
647,HERMIONE," Come on, Harry.",1,female
648,HERMIONE," Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?",1,female
687,HOOCH," Good afternoon, class.",1,female
688,HOOCH," Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. {to class} Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, Up!",1,female
689,HOOCH, With feeling!,1,female
690,HOOCH," Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. {Class mounts} When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...{tweet!}",1,female
691,HOOCH, Mr. Longbottom.,1,female
692,HOOCH, {Neville begins soaring away} M-M-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!,1,female
693,HOOCH, Mr. Longbottom!,1,female
694,HOOCH, Come back down this instant!,1,female
695,HOOCH, Mr. Longbottom! {Neville approaches. The students scatter and Hooch dives out of the way. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.},1,female
696,HOOCH," Everyone out of the way! {She runs through the group, and they scatter.} Come on, get up.",1,female
697,HOOCH," Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. {Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.} Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. {Exit.}",1,female
698,HOOCH," Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. {looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.}",1,female
699,HOOCH, {Blows whistle} Gryffindor win!,1,female
1169,MRS. WEASLEY," Harry!  How wonderful to see you. Beds empty!  No note!  You could've died!  You could've been seen! I don't blame you, of course, dear.",2,female
1170,MRS. WEASLEY," You best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Care for a spot of tea, Harry?",2,female
1171,MRS. WEASLEY, This morning.  Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey house and back last night.,2,female
1172,MRS. WEASLEY," That must be Errol with the post. Fetch him, will you, George?",2,female
1173,MRS. WEASLEY, We'll manage.  Right then. There's only one place to get all of this.,2,female
1174,MRS. WEASLEY," You first, Harry dear.",2,female
1175,MRS. WEASLEY," Percy.  Would you mind going first, so Harry can see how it's done?",2,female
1176,MRS. WEASLEY," Remember to speak clearly, dear!",2,female
1177,MRS. WEASLEY," Oh, Harry.  Thank goodness.  We hoped you'd only gone one grate too far.  Come now.  We're off to Flourish and Blotts.",2,female
1178,MRS. WEASLEY, There he is!,2,female
1179,MRS. WEASLEY, Oh dear!  The train'll be leaving any moment!  All together now!,2,female
1180,MRS. WEASLEY," Go on, Ginny.  You know what to do.",2,female
1181,MRS. WEASLEY," A diary that writes back to you! Honestly, Ginny!  What were you thinking?  Haven't I always told you?  Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain!",2,female
1272,HERMIONE," Hello, Hagrid.  Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again.",2,female
1273,HERMIONE, Oculus Reparo.,2,female
1274,HERMIONE, C'mon.  Everyone's been so worried.,2,female
1275,HERMIONE," Isn't it thrilling!  Gilderoy Lockhart's going to be there!  We can actually meet him!  I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist!",2,female
1276,HERMIONE, Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.,2,female
1277,HERMIONE, I should think you'd count yourself lucky that's all you got.,2,female
1278,HERMIONE," Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been transfigured to their original state.  It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.",2,female
1279,HERMIONE, Immobilus!,2,female
1280,HERMIONE, I'm sure Professor Lockhart just wanted to give us some hands-on experience.,2,female
1281,HERMIONE, Rubbish.  Read his books.  You'll see all the amazing things he's done.,2,female
1282,HERMIONE, At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.,2,female
1283,HERMIONE, Ron!  Say something!,2,female
1284,HERMIONE, He called me a Mudblood.,2,female
1285,HERMIONE, It means dirty blood.  Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who was Muggle-born.  Someone with non-magic parents.  Someone... like me.  It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.,2,female
1286,HERMIONE, Harry!,2,female
1287,HERMIONE, Voice?  What voice?,2,female
1288,HERMIONE, 'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened...?',2,female
1289,HERMIONE, Look at that.  Have you ever seen spiders act like that?  Ron...?,2,female
1290,HERMIONE," That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor.  We'd just found him when Harry said...",2,female
1291,HERMIONE, Harry.  This voice. heard it first in Lockhart's office?,2,female
1292,HERMIONE, And did he hear it?,2,female
1293,HERMIONE," I hardly think someone with Gilderoy Lockhart's credentials would lie to one of his students, Ronald.  Besides, if you recall, we didn't hear anything either.",2,female
1294,HERMIONE," 'Course we do.  It's just... it's a bit weird, isn't it?  You hear this voice and then... Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified.",2,female
1295,HERMIONE," No, Harry.  Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.",2,female
1296,HERMIONE," Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets?",2,female
1297,HERMIONE," Yes, Professor.  But there seems to be very little written about the Chamber of Secrets.  For those of us with a personal interest in the subject, that is... disturbing.",2,female
1298,HERMIONE, Muggle-borns.,2,female
1299,HERMIONE," Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?",2,female
1300,HERMIONE, Yes.  Couldn't you tell: McGonagall's worried.  All the teachers are.,2,female
1301,HERMIONE," The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts.  The question is, who is it?",2,female
1302,HERMIONE, If you're talking about him --,2,female
1303,HERMIONE, I heard him.  But Malfoy?  The Heir of Slytherin?,2,female
1304,HERMIONE," No.  Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about fifty school rules.  And it would be dangerous.  Very dangerous.",2,female
1305,HERMIONE," Here it is:  'The Polyjuice Potion.  Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another...'",2,female
1306,HERMIONE, Yes.,2,female
1307,HERMIONE," Exactly.  But it's tricky.  I've never seen a more complicated potion.  Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed.  And, of course, we'll need a bit of whoever we want to change into too.",2,female
1308,HERMIONE, A month.,2,female
1309,HERMIONE, You didn't have to tell me that.,2,female
1310,HERMIONE," You're joking, right?  Besides, even with a proper wand, it's too risky.  You could hit Harry.",2,female
1311,HERMIONE, Finite Incantatem!,2,female
1312,HERMIONE," You will be able to, won't you?",2,female
1313,HERMIONE," Again?  You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?",2,female
1314,HERMIONE, Maybe.  We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.,2,female
1315,HERMIONE, Never.  No one over comes in here.,2,female
1316,HERMIONE, Moaning Myrtle.,2,female
1317,HERMIONE, She's a little sensitive.,2,female
1318,HERMIONE, Do you think he's all right?,2,female
1319,HERMIONE, You can talk to snakes.,2,female
1320,HERMIONE," No.  They can't.  It's not a very common gift, Harry.  This is bad.",2,female
1321,HERMIONE," I don't know, Harry.  But it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something.  It was... creepy.",2,female
1322,HERMIONE," Harry, listen out me.  There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.  Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.  He could talk to snakes too.",2,female
1323,HERMIONE, He lived a thousand years ago. For all we know... you could be.,2,female
1324,HERMIONE, Harry!,2,female
1325,HERMIONE," You don't believe that, Harry, I know you don't.  And if it makes you feel better, I just heard Malfoy's staying over for holiday, too.",2,female
1326,HERMIONE," Because, in a few days, the Polyjuice Potion's will be ready. In a few days... we may truly know who is the Heir of Slytherin.",2,female
1327,HERMIONE, Everything's set.  We just need a bit of who you're changing into.,2,female
1328,HERMIONE, And we also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.,2,female
1329,HERMIONE," I've got it all worked out.  I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.  Simple, but powerful.",2,female
1330,HERMIONE, You know how greedy Crabbe and Goyle are.  They won't leave the Christmas Feast until every last drop of trifle is gone.,2,female
1331,HERMIONE, I've already got mine.,2,female
1332,HERMIONE, Millicent Bulstrode.  She's in Slytherin.  I got this off her robes. All right then... I'm going to check on the Polyjuice Potion.,2,female
1333,HERMIONE, Remember.  Just make sure Crabbe and Goyle find these.,2,female
1334,HERMIONE, Did you get it?,2,female
1335,HERMIONE, I sneaked those out of the laundry.,2,female
1336,HERMIONE," I'm sure I've done everything right.  It looks like the book said it should.  Once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.",2,female
1337,HERMIONE, We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.,2,female
1338,HERMIONE, Go away!,2,female
1339,HERMIONE, It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes!  Look at my face!,2,female
1340,HERMIONE," Oh, good.  Put those anywhere.",2,female
1341,HERMIONE," I've got to keep up, haven't I?",2,female
1342,HERMIONE," Any day now, according to Madam Pomfrey.  I'm just thankful I've stopped coughing up fur balls.",2,female
1343,HERMIONE, Now.  What about the Chamber of Secrets?  Any new leads?,2,female
1344,HERMIONE, And has it gotten any better?  I mean... is anyone speaking to you?,2,female
1345,HERMIONE, Of course not.  I don't know how that got there.  Now go.  I still have six hundred pages to read in Transformation Through the Ages.,2,female
1346,HERMIONE, Tom Riddle... Hm.  And Ron said he won an award fifty years ago?,2,female
1347,HERMIONE, Fifty years ago?  You're sure?,2,female
1348,HERMIONE, Don't you remember what Malfoy told you?  The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened was --,2,female
1349,HERMIONE," Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts, when it happened.  What if he wrote about what he saw?  It's possible he knew where the Chamber was, how to open it, even what sort of creature lives in it.  If so, whoever's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want a diary like this lying around, would they?",2,female
1350,HERMIONE, It might be invisible ink. Aparecium!,2,female
1351,HERMIONE," I don't know, Harry.  But I think you should be careful with this. Something tells me Ron might be right.  It could be dangerous.",2,female
1352,HERMIONE," I'm scared, Harry.  But not of you.",2,female
1353,HERMIONE, It can't be Hagrid.  It just can't be.,2,female
1354,HERMIONE, Look.  Hagrid's our friend.  Why don't we just go ask him about it?,2,female
1355,HERMIONE," It had to be a Gryffindor.  Nobody else knows our password.  Unless, it wasn't a student...",2,female
1356,HERMIONE, Harry... I think I've just understood something!  I've got to go to the library!,2,female
1357,HERMIONE, You solved it!  You solved it!,2,female
1358,HERMIONE," Oh, no!",2,female
1422,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?",2,female
1423,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Not today, Mr. Weasley.  But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be sending owls to both of your families tonight.  And you will each get a detention.",2,female
1424,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Today, we will be turning animals into water goblets.",2,female
1425,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Now, who would like to go first... Mr. Weasley?",2,female
1426,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," You must replace that wand, Mr. Weasley.",2,female
1427,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Yes, Miss Granger?",2,female
1428,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," My subject is Transfiguration, Miss Granger.",2,female
1429,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Very well.  You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age:",2,female
1430,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts.  He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, purebloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. According to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets.  Shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school.  The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber of Secrets and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.",2,female
1431,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Yes.  Naturally, the school has been searched many times for such a chamber.  It has never been found.",2,female
1432,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, The Chamber is said to be home to something which the heir of Slytherin alone can control.  It is said to be home... to a monster.,2,female
1433,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Perhaps he managed to get a picture of his attacker...,2,female
1434,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," What does this mean, Albus?",2,female
1435,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," What sould I tell the staff, Albus?",2,female
1436,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," This is out of my hands, Potter. Mr. Filch, will you take care of this, please?",2,female
1437,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Sherbet lemon.,2,female
1438,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you.,2,female
1439,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, This match has been cancelled.,2,female
1440,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Silence, Wood!  You will return to Gryffindor Tower now.  Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you need to see.",2,female
1441,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, I warn you.  This will be a bit of a shock.,2,female
1442,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, She was found near the library. Along with this.  Does it mean anything to either of you?,2,female
1443,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock in the evening.  You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher.  No exceptions. I should tell you all this. Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely that the school will be closed.",2,female
1444,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message.  Our worst fear has been realized.  A student has been taken by the monster.  Into the Chamber itself. I'm afraid we shall have to send the students home.  I'm afraid... this is the end of Hogwarts.",2,female
1445,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," That settles it.  We'll leave it to you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.  Your skills, after all, are legend.",2,female
1446,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, The rest of us should go and inform the students what has happened.,2,female
1447,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Ginny Weasley.,2,female
1448,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Certainly, Albus.",2,female
1491,MOANING MYRTLE," I'm Moaning Myrtle.  I wouldn't expect you to know me.  Who would ever talk about fat, ugly, miserable, moping, moaning Myrtle?",2,female
1492,MOANING MYRTLE," Ooh, wait till you see.  It's awful!",2,female
1493,MOANING MYRTLE, Come to throw something else at me?,2,female
1494,MOANING MYRTLE," Don’t ask me.  Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me...",2,female
1495,MOANING MYRTLE," Oh sure!  Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach.  Fifty points if it goes through her head!",2,female
1496,MOANING MYRTLE," I don't know.  I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death and it fell through the top of my head.",2,female
1497,MOANING MYRTLE, I HEARD THAT!,2,female
1498,MOANING MYRTLE," Who's there?  Oh... Hello, Harry.  What do you want?",2,female
1499,MOANING MYRTLE," Oooooh, it was dreadful.  It happened right here.  In this very cubicle.  I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.  I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in.",2,female
1500,MOANING MYRTLE," I don't know!  I was distraught! But they said something funny.  A kind of made-up language.  And I realized it was a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go away, and... I died.",2,female
1501,MOANING MYRTLE, No idea.  I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes. Over there...,2,female
1502,MOANING MYRTLE," Oh, Harry... if you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.",2,female
1757,AUNT MARGE, Wretched.  Ripper got sick.,3,female
1758,AUNT MARGE," I would've left him with the others, but he pines so when I'm away.  Don't you, darling?",3,female
1759,AUNT MARGE," So.  Still here, are you?",3,female
1760,AUNT MARGE," Don’t say 'yes' in that ungrateful tone.  Damn good of my brother to keep you, if you ask me. It'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.",3,female
1761,AUNT MARGE, Is that my Dudders!  Hm?  Is that my neffy poo?  Come and say hello to your Auntie Marge.,3,female
1762,AUNT MARGE," Just a small one.  A bit more... a bit more... That's the boy. Aah.  Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-up for me, what with twelve dogs.",3,female
1763,AUNT MARGE," What are you smirking at!  Where is it that you send him, Vernon?",3,female
1764,AUNT MARGE," I see.  And do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?",3,female
1765,AUNT MARGE," Excellent.  I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. Still.  Mustn't blame yourself for how this one's turned out, Vernon. It all comes down to blood.  Bad blood will out.  What is it the boy's father did, Petunia?",3,female
1766,AUNT MARGE," Of course.  And a drunk, I expect --",3,female
1767,AUNT MARGE, What did you say?,3,female
1768,AUNT MARGE," Not to worry, Petunia.  I have a very firm grip.",3,female
1769,AUNT MARGE," Quiet, Vernon.  It doesn't matter about the father.  In the end it comes down to the mother.  You see it all the time with dogs.  If there's something wrong with the bitch, there'll be something wrong with the pup...",3,female
1770,AUNT MARGE, Vernon.  Don't you dare --,3,female
1880,HERMIONE," That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. It's all right, Crookshanks.  You just ignore the mean little boy...",3,female
1881,HERMIONE," You know, the ancient Egyptians of the Nile River delta worshipped the cat goddess Bast.",3,female
1882,HERMIONE," Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry's lucky he wasn't expelled.",3,female
1883,HERMIONE, C'mon.  We're in here.,3,female
1884,HERMIONE, Professor R.J. Lupin.,3,female
1885,HERMIONE, It's on his case.,3,female
1886,HERMIONE," Seems to be.  Why?  What is it, Harry?",3,female
1887,HERMIONE," But they'll catch Black, won't they?  I mean... eventually?",3,female
1888,HERMIONE, Why're we stopping?  We can't be there yet...,3,female
1889,HERMIONE," Ouch!  Ron, that was my foot!",3,female
1890,HERMIONE," Harry?  Harry, are you all right?",3,female
1891,HERMIONE," It was searching the train, Harry. For Sirius Black.",3,female
1892,HERMIONE, I was trembling.  Cold.  But then... Professor Lupin made it go away...,3,female
1893,HERMIONE," No one was screaming, Harry.",3,female
1894,HERMIONE," Of course!  That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.",3,female
1895,HERMIONE, Me?  I've been here all along.,3,female
1896,HERMIONE," Death omens.  Honestly.  If you ask me, Divination's a very wooly discipline.  Now Ancient Runes. That's a fascinating subject.",3,female
1897,HERMIONE, A fair few.,3,female
1898,HERMIONE, Don't be silly.  How could anyone be in two classes at once? Broaden your minds...,3,female
1899,HERMIONE," Hagrid.  He's got to be taken to a hospital.  I'll go with you, if you like --",3,female
1900,HERMIONE, Yes.  But I hear Draco's father's furious.  I don't think we've heard the end of this...,3,female
1901,HERMIONE, Achintee?  That's not far from here...,3,female
1902,HERMIONE, No one knows.,3,female
1903,HERMIONE, Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears most. That's what makes it so --,3,female
1904,HERMIONE," And the post office!  It's about 200 owls, all sitting on color- coded shelves, depending on how fast you want your letter to go!",3,female
1905,HERMIONE," But, I mean, after awhile, it got a bit boring.  Don't you think, Ron?",3,female
1906,HERMIONE," But, sir, we've only just begun learning about Red Caps and Hinkypunks.  We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts for weeks --",3,female
1907,HERMIONE, No!!!,3,female
1908,HERMIONE, Harry!  How're you feeling?,3,female
1909,HERMIONE," No one blames you, Harry.  The Dementors aren't meant to come on the grounds.  Dumbledore was furious.  After he saved you, he sent them straight off.",3,female
1910,HERMIONE, It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain.  Did I mention that?,3,female
1911,HERMIONE, Should we move a bit closer?,3,female
1912,HERMIONE, Perfect.,3,female
1913,HERMIONE, Hope you don't mean yourself.,3,female
1914,HERMIONE, Harry...?  Harry?,3,female
1915,HERMIONE," But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall, aren't you?",3,female
1916,HERMIONE," Oh, shut up.",3,female
1917,HERMIONE, That's Madam Rosmerta.  Ron fancies her.,3,female
1918,HERMIONE, That's a lie!,3,female
1919,HERMIONE," Harry.  Will you explain to your friend Ronald that he has absolutely no proof whatsoever that my sweet, unassuming cat ate his shabby, decidedly decrepit rat.",3,female
1920,HERMIONE," How'd it go, Hagrid?",3,female
1921,HERMIONE, I meant the hearing.,3,female
1922,HERMIONE, And...?,3,female
1923,HERMIONE," You mustn't blame yourself, Hagrid.",3,female
1924,HERMIONE," Where's he going, Hagrid?",3,female
1925,HERMIONE, Here we go again.  It's the Grim! It's the Grim!,3,female
1926,HERMIONE, I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak!  It's too horrible.,3,female
1927,HERMIONE, You... foul... loathsome... evil... little cockroach...,3,female
1928,HERMIONE, That felt good.,3,female
1929,HERMIONE," We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.",3,female
1930,HERMIONE, I think you owe someone an apology.,3,female
1931,HERMIONE, I meant me.,3,female
1932,HERMIONE," Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind.",3,female
1933,HERMIONE, Ron!  No!,3,female
1934,HERMIONE, Harry.  You do realize what tree this is...,3,female
1935,HERMIONE, I've got you --,3,female
1936,HERMIONE, Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!!,3,female
1937,HERMIONE, Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!,3,female
1938,HERMIONE, Thanks.,3,female
1939,HERMIONE, Where do you suppose this goes?,3,female
1940,HERMIONE," We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?",3,female
1941,HERMIONE, Ron!  You're okay --,3,female
1942,HERMIONE," If you want to kill Harry, you'll -- you'll... have to kill us, too!",3,female
1943,HERMIONE, Harry!  No!,3,female
1944,HERMIONE, No!  I trusted you!  I covered up for you.  And all this time you've been his friend! He's a werewolf!  That's why he's been missing classes!,3,female
1945,HERMIONE, Since Professor Snape set the essay.,3,female
1946,HERMIONE, Harry.  You attacked a teacher.,3,female
1947,HERMIONE, Don't worry.  He's under the Somnambulist Charm.  It's primarily used to transport the seriously deranged.,3,female
1948,HERMIONE, Harry...,3,female
1949,HERMIONE, Professor...?,3,female
1950,HERMIONE, Harry!,3,female
1951,HERMIONE, Harry --,3,female
1952,HERMIONE, What...?,3,female
1953,HERMIONE," Listen, Harry.  They've captured Sirius.  Any minute the Dementors are going to perform the Kiss.",3,female
1954,HERMIONE, It's what Dementors do to those they want to destroy.  They clamp their jaws over the victim's mouth and... suck out his soul.,3,female
1955,HERMIONE, No.  It's worse.  Much worse.  You go on living.  But you have no memory.  No sense of self.  You're just a shall.  An empty shell...,3,female
1956,HERMIONE, Headmaster!  You've got to stop them!  They've got the wrong man!,3,female
1957,HERMIONE," The point is... we know the truth. Please, sir, you must believe us.",3,female
1958,HERMIONE," Sorry, Ron.  But seeing as you can't walk...",3,female
1959,HERMIONE, Seven-thirty.  Where were we at seven-thirty?,3,female
1960,HERMIONE, Come on!  We can't be seen!,3,female
1961,HERMIONE," This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term.  This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.",3,female
1962,HERMIONE, Yes.  Dumbledore wanted us to return to this moment.  Clearly something happened he wants us to change.,3,female
1963,HERMIONE, Hurry!  Malfoy's coming!,3,female
1964,HERMIONE," Of course!  Remember what Dumbledore said.  If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.",3,female
1965,HERMIONE, We'll see.,3,female
1966,HERMIONE, What?,3,female
1967,HERMIONE," No!  Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.  Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free!",3,female
1968,HERMIONE," No, Harry!  You can't!",3,female
1969,HERMIONE," Yes!  You Must! Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut right now.  If you go bursting inside, you'll think you've gone mad.  Awful things can happen when wizards meddle with time.  We can't be seen.",3,female
1970,HERMIONE, Fudge is coming and... we're not leaving... why aren't we leaving?,3,female
1971,HERMIONE, Sorry.,3,female
1972,HERMIONE, C'mon.  Any minute now we're going to be coming out the back door.,3,female
1973,HERMIONE, Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?,3,female
1974,HERMIONE," Now, Harry!",3,female
1975,HERMIONE," Here, Beaky... Come and get the nice dead ferret... yum yum...",3,female
1976,HERMIONE, We save Sirius.,3,female
1977,HERMIONE, No idea.,3,female
1978,HERMIONE, Look.  It's Lupin.,3,female
1979,HERMIONE, Here comes Snape.,3,female
1980,HERMIONE, Now we wait.,3,female
1981,HERMIONE, 'Least someone's enjoying himself.,3,female
1982,HERMIONE, Yes?,3,female
1983,HERMIONE," With a Patronus.  I heard Snape telling Dumbledore when we were taken to the hospital.  According to him, only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.",3,female
1984,HERMIONE," But, Harry, your Dad's...",3,female
1985,HERMIONE, Here we come.,3,female
1986,HERMIONE, Really?,3,female
1987,HERMIONE, It's happened.  Lupin's transformed.,3,female
1988,HERMIONE, Saving your life.,3,female
1989,HERMIONE, Why?,3,female
1990,HERMIONE, Buckbeak.  We've got to find him.,3,female
1991,HERMIONE, Poor Professor Lupin is having a really tough night...,3,female
1992,HERMIONE, This is horrible...,3,female
1993,HERMIONE," No one's coming, Harry...",3,female
1994,HERMIONE," No one's coming!  You're dying, both of you... and no one's coming!",3,female
1995,HERMIONE," HARRY, NO!",3,female
1996,HERMIONE, No. But I don't like this!,3,female
1997,HERMIONE, Out of the way! Alohomora!,3,female
1998,HERMIONE, Didn't really expect that to work.,3,female
1999,HERMIONE, Dunamis!  Liberare!  Annihilare! Emancipare!,3,female
2000,HERMIONE, Quiet!  I'm trying to think.,3,female
2001,HERMIONE, BOMBARDA!,3,female
2002,HERMIONE, We have to go.,3,female
2003,HERMIONE," What d'you think, Harry?  Too much for him -- everything that's happened tonight?",3,female
2004,HERMIONE, It's a mystery.  Though... this fell out of the wrapping.,3,female
2157,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY," ... the Sight.  Hello.  I am Professor Trelawney.  Together, we shall cast ourselves into the future.  But know this.  One either has the Gift or not.  It cannot be divined from the pages of a book.  Books only cloud one's Inner Eye.",3,female
2158,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY," You, boy!  Is your grandmother well?",3,female
2159,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY," I wouldn't be so sure of that. The first term will be devoted to the reading of tea leaves.  If all goes well, we will proceed to palmistry, fire omens, and finally... the crystal ball. By the way, dear, beware a red- haired man.",3,female
2160,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY," Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of flu.  I myself will lose my voice.  And in late spring, one of our number will... leave us forever.",3,female
2161,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY, Well then.  Shall we?,3,female
2162,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY," Broaden your minds, my dears.  And allow your eyes to see... beyond.",3,female
2163,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY," A five-leaf clover... You can expect to wake with a horrible rash tomorrow morning, dear. Mr. Longbottom, after you've broken your first cup...",3,female
2164,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY," ... would you be so kind as to select one of the blue ones?  I'm rather partial to the pink. What do you see in Mr. Potter's cup, Mr. Weasley?",3,female
2165,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY, Ahhh!,3,female
2166,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY, My dear boy... You have the Grim.,3,female
2167,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY," Crystal-gazing requires that you clear the Inner Eye.  Only then, will you... See.  Oh my, what do we have here...?",3,female
2168,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY," My dear, from the moment you first arrived in my class, I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination.  You may be young in years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave.",3,female
2169,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY," On these occasions, I take no joy in my gift, Miss Brown.",3,female
2170,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY, He will return tonight,3,female
2171,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY," Tonight, when the clock strikes twelve, the servant shall break free.  He and his Master shall be reunited.  It cannot be prevented.",3,female
2172,PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY," So sorry, dear boy.  Did you say something?",3,female
2221,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Remember!  These visits to Hogsmeade Village are a privilege. Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in any way, that privilege shall not be extended again.",3,female
2222,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," No permission form.  No visiting the Village.  That's the rule, Potter.",3,female
2223,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," But I don't say so.  A parent or guardian must sign, and since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. I'm sorry, Potter.  But that's my final word.",3,female
2224,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents were marked for death, they went into hiding.  Few knew where they were.  One who did was black.  And he told...",3,female
2225,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Little lump of a boy?  Always tagging after Black and...,3,female
2226,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," After the Potters were killed, Pettigrew went looking for Black. And, unfortunately... found him.",3,female
2227,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the reason they're dead.  And now he wants to finish what he started.",3,female
2228,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, This:  Sirius Black was and remains today... Harry Potter's godfather.,3,female
2229,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," That's preposterous, Weasley.  How could Sirius Black possibly have got through the portrait hole?",3,female
2230,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Silence!,3,female
2231,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Which abysmally foolish person wrote down the passwords and then proceeded to lose them!,3,female
2232,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Is it always going to be you, Longbottom?",3,female
2233,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," While we know Sirius Black is gone tonight, I think you can safely assume he will, at some future time, attempt to return.  Let me be clear.  You are not to move about the castle alone.  And you are not to write down the password!  Understood!",3,female
2234,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Very well then.  Go to bed.,3,female
2322,HERMIONE, Harry!,4,female
2323,HERMIONE, Are you alright?,4,female
2324,HERMIONE, Just now. You?,4,female
2325,HERMIONE, Wake up. Wake up Ronald!,4,female
2326,HERMIONE," Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready.",4,female
2327,HERMIONE, What??,4,female
2328,HERMIONE, Harry it's his mark.,4,female
2329,HERMIONE," This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?",4,female
2330,HERMIONE," It's hurting again isn't it, your scar. ",4,female
2331,HERMIONE," You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream.",4,female
2332,HERMIONE, Alastor Moody? The aura.,4,female
2333,HERMIONE, Three sir.,4,female
2334,HERMIONE, Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will...,4,female
2335,HERMIONE," Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!",4,female
2336,HERMIONE," There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face. ",4,female
2337,HERMIONE, Neville?,4,female
2338,HERMIONE, It's not going to work.,4,female
2339,HERMIONE, You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.,4,female
2340,HERMIONE, So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.,4,female
2341,HERMIONE, Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake. ,4,female
2342,HERMIONE, (Whispering to Ron) We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?,4,female
2343,HERMIONE, Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you.,4,female
2344,HERMIONE, Uhhh...,4,female
2345,HERMIONE, Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.,4,female
2346,HERMIONE, I'm NOT an owl!,4,female
2347,HERMIONE, Pssst! Harry? Is that you?,4,female
2348,HERMIONE, How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...,4,female
2349,HERMIONE, Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.,4,female
2350,HERMIONE, Your wand harry! Your wand!,4,female
2351,HERMIONE, Boys.,4,female
2352,HERMIONE, (Reading a newspaper) Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.,4,female
2353,HERMIONE, They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.,4,female
2354,HERMIONE, It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.,4,female
2355,HERMIONE, Oh well spotted.,4,female
2356,HERMIONE, I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.,4,female
2357,HERMIONE, What?,4,female
2358,HERMIONE, No of course.,4,female
2359,HERMIONE, She said yes??,4,female
2360,HERMIONE, Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?,4,female
2361,HERMIONE, What's got your wand in a knot?,4,female
2362,HERMIONE," The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends.",4,female
2363,HERMIONE, How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.,4,female
2364,HERMIONE, What? What? That's what you think? ,4,female
2365,HERMIONE, You know the solution then don't you. ,4,female
2366,HERMIONE," Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort.",4,female
2367,HERMIONE, Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.,4,female
2368,HERMIONE, Ron you spoil everything!,4,female
2369,HERMIONE, Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.,4,female
2370,HERMIONE," I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?",4,female
2371,HERMIONE," I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.",4,female
2372,HERMIONE," Harry, tell me again.",4,female
2373,HERMIONE," The black lake, that's obvious.",4,female
2374,HERMIONE," Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic",4,female
2375,HERMIONE," Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.",4,female
2376,HERMIONE," But sir, the second task is only hours away and...",4,female
2377,HERMIONE, Harry!,4,female
2378,HERMIONE, Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably. ,4,female
2379,HERMIONE, Next to last.,4,female
2380,HERMIONE, Bye.,4,female
2381,HERMIONE, No.,4,female
2382,HERMIONE, Everything's going to change now isn't it?,4,female
2383,HERMIONE, Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.,4,female
2384,HERMIONE, Harry will won't you?,4,female
2883,MCGONAGALL," This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this?",4,female
2884,MCGONAGALL, Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete. ,4,female
2885,MCGONAGALL, Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you accomodate them... ,4,female
2886,MCGONAGALL, Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of meat.,4,female
2887,MCGONAGALL, Professor Moody what are you doing? ,4,female
2888,MCGONAGALL, Is that a student?,4,female
2889,MCGONAGALL," We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore told you that.",4,female
2890,MCGONAGALL, Well you will do well to remember it. ,4,female
2891,MCGONAGALL," The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance.",4,female
2892,MCGONAGALL," Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons. ",4,female

2895,MCGONAGALL," Now, place your right hand on my waist. ",4,female
2896,MCGONAGALL, My waist.,4,female

2899,MCGONAGALL, Everybody come together.,4,female
2900,MCGONAGALL," Boys, on your feet.",4,female
2901,MCGONAGALL, Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready?,4,female
2902,MCGONAGALL, To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that.,4,female
2903,MCGONAGALL," Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great hall with Miss Patil.",4,female
2904,RITA, What a charismatic quartet. Hello! ,4,female
2905,RITA," I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily prophet. But of course you know that don't you. It's you we don't know, you're the news. What quirks lurk beneath those rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles mask? does courage lie beneath those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick. Me, myself and I want to know. Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we start with the youngest. Lovely. ",4,female
2906,RITA, This is cosy.,4,female
2907,RITA, You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use the quill do you? ,4,female
2908,RITA," So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve..",4,female
2909,RITA, ...about to compete against three students. Not only vastly more emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned?,4,female
2910,RITA, Course you're not just any ordinary boy of twelve are you...,4,female
2911,RITA, The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament.,4,female
2912,RITA," Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel Harry. (to the quill) Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how do you think they'd feel? proud? or concerned that your attitude shows at best a pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic deathwish.",4,female

3199,HERMIONE," Would you like a hug? No,  I'd  hate  to  force  you... Well,  come  on,  Harry.  Time  to  go.",5,female
3200,HERMIONE," Harry,  Ron  and  I,  we've  been  named House Prefects!",5,female
3201,HERMIONE," What  about  you,  Harry? Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one!",5,female
3202,HERMIONE," Well...thanks  Harry. Come on, lets go back downstairs!",5,female
3203,HERMIONE, I hope he's all right... What  if  he  were  still  on  his... ...what if he's still on his mission  from Dumbledore?,5,female
3204,HERMIONE," I wanted to know something about your course aims. Well,  they  should  be  perfectly  self- evident. Well,  I  don't  think  they  are.  They say nothing about actually doing spells.",5,female
3205,HERMIONE, But  surely  the  whole  point  of Defense against the dark arts is practical application?,5,female
3206,HERMIONE," No,  but- Then you have  no  business challenging those who are. We will  be learning about spells in a safe, risk-free  environment- But  we've  got  O.W.L.s  coming  up! You  expect us  to  do  the  spells  with no practice? What  good's  theory  in  the  real world? This is school, not the real world, Mr.  Potter. There  is  nothing  out there  waiting  to  get  you.",5,female
3207,HERMIONE," Good luck, Harry.",5,female
3208,HERMIONE," Hey,  Harry.",5,female
3209,HERMIONE, Have you seen Ron? I can't find him anywhere.,5,female
3210,HERMIONE," He's  been  acting  fishy  all  week. He's  up  to something. huh. That's enough for tonight, Potter. Let's see that hand. Harry! I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts! I'm on the team! Harry--bloody hell! He's  got  to  be  taken  to  the hospital wing. No.  Can't  give...Umbridge  the satisfaction... Umbridge  did  this? You said she was making you do lines! She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses blood for ink.",5,female
3211,HERMIONE, That old hag! She's sick!,5,female
3212,HERMIONE," Oh,  Harry.  You've  got  to  go  to Dumbledore. You can't keep this up. No,  I'm  telling  anyone.",5,female
3213,HERMIONE," Harry,  I  really  think  you  should tell--",5,female
3214,HERMIONE," I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it's  unlikely. Dumbledore'd  know. Yeah, but Dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he? She'd been sent here  by  the  Ministry. Anything about Harry?",5,female
3215,HERMIONE," No,  nothing. Wait!  Look  at  this!",5,female
3216,HERMIONE," ""Trespass  at  Ministry.  Sturgis Podmore has appeared before the Wizengamot with charges of trespass and attempted robbery at the Ministry of Magic on the 31st of August.

Unless whoever tipped Filch off was interested  in reading  your  mail, Harry.  I  mean,  doesn't  it seem  a little too coincidental that Filch was tipped off when you happened to be sending a message to Sirius? Yeah,  that  does  seem  weird.  You figure its Umbridge?",5,female

It is likely that you have been seeing quite a lot of Harry Potter of  late.  I  must  recommend  you break ties with that boy as soon as possible. He may be Dumbledore's favorite, but Dumbledore may not be in  charge  at  Hogwarts  much  longer. Your loyalties should lie with the Ministry  of Magic,  not  Dumbledore and Potter's personality cult. Please do not fear breaking ties with Potter. If trouble arrises, go to  Dolores  Umbridge,  a truly delightful woman. I hope you will carefully consider my  advice  to you,  Ron.  Don't  let the dangerous errors of Dumbledore, Potter, and unfortunately  our parents lure you into destroying a perfectly good career. Percy."" Well,  if  you  want  to,  ah,  ""break ties""  with  me, I  swear  I  won't  get violent. He  is  the  world's  biggest git! Watch it! Sirius? Right  you  are.  Got  you  letter  and though we should talk in person. What  was  that?",5,female
3222,HERMIONE, Except he did mention that Dumbledore might not be in charge here much longer. It  doesn't  surprise  me.  Fudge  wants Dumbledore out.,5,female
3223,HERMIONE," What? Dumbledore's not worried about him, though. Hagrid's  tough.  He'll  be all right. But  if  he  was  supposed  to  be  back by now... Look, asking questions about  him will only make it more obvious that he's not back. Get  out  of  here!",5,female

3228,HERMIONE, These are some people I mentioned my  Defense Against  the  Dark  Arts idea with.,5,female
3229,HERMIONE," Hi,  everyone.  I  thought  it  would  be good if we met and talked over how we wanted to teach ourselves Defense  Against  the  Dark  Arts. Because we need to learn it properly, not the rubbish Umbridge is doing. Hear, hear! Obviously,  this  will  help  us  pass our  O.W.L.s, but  more  importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves  from...Lord  Voldemort. That's the first time you've said his  name. How  do  we  know  You-Know-Who's really back?",5,female
3230,HERMIONE," That's  true,  but  I  think  we're drifting from the purpose--",5,female
3231,HERMIONE, Where  are  we  going  to  meet? What  about  an  unused  classroom?,5,female
3232,HERMIONE," Ok,  good. I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here. I  don't  know...if  it  were  found...I mean, Umbridge  wouldn't  like  what we're doing... Honestly,  Ernie,  do  you  think  I'd just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted. Also, what should we call ourselves? What  about  the  Anti-Unbridhe League?",5,female
3233,HERMIONE, We need something that doesn't give away  what we're  doing. I think it should be Dumbledore's Army.,5,female
3234,HERMIONE," Dumbledore's Army it is, then. The D.A. for short.",5,female
3235,HERMIONE, We'll  let  you  know  when  we're  going to meet.,5,female

3237,HERMIONE," And did you see Cho, Harry? about  her?",5,female
3238,HERMIONE," Well,  she  couldn't  keep  her eyes off you, could she?!",5,female

3241,HERMIONE, Hagrid's  back!,5,female
3242,HERMIONE," Can'  answer  tha',  I'm  afraid.  Top secret, that is. Business of the Order. We know you were looking for giants,  Hagrid. Dumbledore  said  so last year. Oh.  Well,  yeah,  I  was,  then.  Went with Madame Maxime. Took us a month to  get  to their  camp. A month? O'  course!  Can'  do  magic,  not  with the Ministry  followin'  us  all  the way. Plus, giants aren't fond o' wizards. Don' trust 'em. So what did you do when you found them? Waited  'till  mornin'  an'  then marched righ' in. We  gave  'em  a  gift,  jus'  like Dumbledore said.  Gave  'em  a  branch o' Gubraithian fire, Everlasting Flame. Giants  love  magic,  see,  jus'  not too fond o' wizards. Nuthin' a giant  loves  better  than magic.",5,female
3243,HERMIONE," Told us what? Neville's  dear  parents  were tortured into insanity by You-Know- Who before he disappeared. Aurors, you  know,  very  well  respected. Another  one,  Alice?  All  right,  come on, Neville.",5,female

3248,HERMIONE," Fan  mail,  Harry!  Responses  to  the article.",5,female
3249,HERMIONE, She's done it to herself. Banning the article will only make people want  to  read  it  more!,5,female
3250,HERMIONE," Of  course  we'll  help. Knew yeh'd say yes! Okay, real quiet like from here on. There we are! Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come! None o' them did, Hermione! I didn' have  much ruddy  choice  inna  matter! I  couldn'  leave  'im!",5,female
3251,HERMIONE," Oh,  why,  Hagrid?  Why? He's  me  brother! Well,  half-brother  anyway.  Me  mum had  'im afore  she  died. I  though'  I  could  bring  'im  back here  an' train  'im  up  a  bit.  Teach 'im  a  bit  o' manners. Here. I'll introduce yeh to Grawp! Yeh all righ', Grawp? Look  wha'  I  brough'  yeh,  Grawpy! Two new  friends  an'  all.  We  'ave Harry  Potter here,  see?  An'  over here is Hermy.",5,female
3252,HERMIONE, How do you know?,5,female
3253,HERMIONE," How'd  Voldemort  get  into  the Ministry of Magic without being seen?  I  mean,  he  and  Sirius  are the two most wanted wizards in the world... Yeah.  They  can't  just  waltz  into the Ministry  of  Magic!",5,female
3254,HERMIONE," It just seems so unlikely, Harry!",5,female
3255,HERMIONE," Yes,  they  can,  Harry.",5,female
3256,HERMIONE," Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at  Headquarters.  Which means  we'll need  to  break  into  Umbridge's office. For  that,  we'll  need  a  really  good distraction. Right  you  are,  Hermione.  Think  we can whip something up, George?",5,female
3257,HERMIONE," Mind you, it's got to be really good! Not  to  worry,  Hermione.  We've  got something that will outdue everything else we've done here combined. It's been too quiet around here anyway. Time we did some real damage to this place. We'll  also  need  to  keep  everyone away from  her  office. We  can  do  that!  Me  and  Luna'll guard  the hallway. We'll  probably  only  manage  five minutes or so.",5,female

3286,UMBRIDGE," Ten  points  from  Gryffindor,  Mr. Potter. Let me set the record straight. Some of you have been told that a certain dead wizard has returned. This is a lie. Y It-is-NOT-a-LIE! Mr.  Potter,  you  have  just  landed yourself in detention! So,  according  to  you,  Cedric Diggory dropped  dead?  Or  are  you calling  me  a murderer? The boy's death was a tragic accident. It was MURDER! I saw it happen! Mr Potter, you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions! Yeah, talk to somebody who cares. Voldemort killed  Cedric,  and  you know it. That  goes  to  Professor  McGonogall, dear. Is this true? Did you shout at Professor Umbridge? Yeah.  But  she  called  me  a  liar! My dear boy, do use your common sense! Umbridge is reporting directly  to  Fudge.  She  is here to...interfere...with  Dumbledore. And things could get much worse, trust  me. Use caution, always, Potter. Do not mess  with Dolorus  Umbridge,  she  is dangerous. The Order's hands are tied  at  Hogwarts,  Harry.  If you  get too deep into trouble, we  may  not be able to get you out. Do you understand?",5,female
3287,UMBRIDGE," Ah,  Potter.  Sit  down.",5,female
3288,UMBRIDGE," You're going to be doing lines, tonight,  Mr.  Potter, and  you'll  be using this quill.",5,female
3289,UMBRIDGE," You  will  write ""I will not tell lies"" until I tell you to stop. Understand?",5,female
3290,UMBRIDGE, Oh...you  won't  need  ink.,5,female
3291,UMBRIDGE," Problem, Potter? That's enough for this evening. Same  time, tomorrow,  and  we'll  see if we  can get the message to sink in a bit deeper.",5,female
3292,UMBRIDGE," Of course. Now, if you would kindly make a prediction for me? The Inner Eye does not See upon command! My dear boy, your dream diary, if you please! My dear boy! My poor boy! These dreams are evil portends! ""Dreamt I was at breakfast eating oatmeal""? Yes, yes, oatmeal! Are you telling me you cannot see the signs? The foretelling of suffering and death?",5,female
3293,UMBRIDGE," Educational  Decree  Twenty-Five.  It gives  me, as  High  Inquisitor,  the power to give punishments and privileges, and to alter  those given out to students by other members of the staff.",5,female
3294,UMBRIDGE," So,  I  think  a  life-long  ban  from playing quidditch should do the trick for both of these. Oh, and this  one's  twin  as  well.  He  was going to  attack  Malfoy  as  well.",5,female
3295,UMBRIDGE," Yes,  indeed,  Mr.  Potter.",5,female
3296,UMBRIDGE," Ah,  I'll  take  your  brooms  as  well.",5,female
3297,UMBRIDGE," Well,  have  a  wonderful  day.",5,female
3298,UMBRIDGE, I can do whatever I wish! This is my home!,5,female
3299,UMBRIDGE," Not  anymore. Now  remove  yourself  from  this castle! She  will  not  be  leaving. I  have  the  authority,  Headmaster! Oh,  I  agree  with  you,  Professor Umbridge. You  do  have  the  power  to dismiss  my teachers.  However... ...You  cannot  send  them  from  this castle. That is still my decision. Professor Trelawney will remain here. And what of her quarters when I appoint a new teacher. Happily, that  will  not  be necessary. I have found a successor for good Professor Trelawney already.  As  you  know... ...the  Ministry  can  only  appoint new teachers if I cannot find one. I think you will find him suitable enough. This is Firenze. So you're saying this weapon You- Know-Who's  after  is  in  the Department of Mysteries? It's got  to be. That's got to be what Surgis Podmore  was doing  in  the  Ministry when he was arrested. Probably.  Mr.  Weasley  was  probably there when he was attacked, too. That  must  be  what  the  Order's guarding! But  why  the  Department  of Mysteries? It makes perfect sense, Ron. It's got  to  be something  the  Ministry's been developing. Something top secret. Look at this. There's been a mass escape from Azkaban. Bloody hell!",5,female
3300,UMBRIDGE, I have just published an article telling the real story about what happened last June.,5,female
3301,UMBRIDGE, Where is this article?,5,female
3302,UMBRIDGE," Right, I will confiscate this. Anyone found in possession of this magazine will be expelled.",5,female
3303,UMBRIDGE," I have a witness right here! Correct again. I must confess that I  was, however,  under  the impression that this young girl only  told  you  a  meeting  was  going on tonight.",5,female
3304,UMBRIDGE," Let's ask her, shall we?",5,female
3305,UMBRIDGE," You can shake your head for an answer,  dear. Now,  have  there  been more meetings?",5,female
3306,UMBRIDGE," What  do  you  mean  by  shaking  your head, girl? I would think that she was saying there  have been  no  other  meetings. Would that be correct? Why are you shaking your head, girl? It  usually  means  'no,'  Dolores. Again,  I  cannot  have  you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge. My apologies, Headmaster. I forgot myself. Well,  what  about  the  meeting tonight? Right.  Of  course.  Well,  we proceeded down to the Room and entered. We caught Potter just outside. But it  doesn't matter.  We've  found  all of  their  names. So,  Dumbledore,  you've  been  behind this whole thing. Dumbledore's  Army. Well,  Minister.  You've  caught  me. This has all been your doing! You've been recruiting students for your army! Quite correct, Cornelius. I knew it! I KNEW it! You've been plotting against me all this time! right. This is too good to be true!",5,female
3307,UMBRIDGE," ""By  Order  of  the  Ministry  of  Magic: Dolores Jane  Umbridge  will  replace Albus  Dumbledore as  Head  of Hogwarts  School  of  Witchcraft  and Wizardry."" My first act as your new Headmistress is to form an Inquisitional Squad, lead by Draco Malfoy. They  will  report  directly to me about the goings on in the halls of this school. Furthermore,  our  good  caretaker, Mr.  Filch has  requested  we reinstate  the  'old punishments.'  I have decided that there is no reason  we  shouldn't. Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it  was important. No way. Quidditch practice. If I don't  show  up, Angelina'll  go  mad. Hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour. Its jus' up ahead, here. Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please? All  righ'.  Well,  I'm  showin'  yeh this,  because tha'  Umbridge  woman put  me  on  probation.  I can'  last much longer afore I get sacked like Trelawney. We won't let her! Bah.  S'not  the  end  o'  the  world.  If I  do,  I'll go  help  Dumbledore. Grea'  man... Anyway,  I  woudn'  tell  yeh  'cept  for tha'.  I  can' leave  withou'  makin' arraingmen's, see? I'll need all o' yer help.",5,female
3308,UMBRIDGE," Hem hem. Now then, Potter, you'll need to concentrate on Defense Against the Dark Arts, Potions, Transfiguration, and Charms to adequately prepare yourself for the general  Auror requirements.",5,female
3309,UMBRIDGE," Hem hem. May I offer you a cough drop, Professor Umbridge? Oh,  no  thank  you,  Minerva. Actually,  I  was just  wondering  if Potter  has  the  proper temperament to  be  an  Auror. Were you indeed. If  you're  serious  in  this  ambition, Potter,  I would  recommend concentrating on bringing your Potions and Charms grades up before your O.W.L.s. I daresay you've got enough time if you apply yourself. Lord knows you've consistently done well  in  Defense  Against  the  Dark Arts. Professor Lupin-- Excuse  me,  Minerva,  but  have  you seen my  note  on  Potter's  current  grades in my class? Yes, indeed I have. Then I think you will find that Potter's grades have been consistently poor this year. You apparently misunderstand me. I meant  that Potter  has  done  well  in every  Defense  Against the  Dark  Arts class  taught  by  a  competent teacher. Now, assuming you've passed all of your necessary classes, the Ministry will put you through a number of character and aptitude tests. What's  involved  in  them? How you stand up under pressure, your perseverance, and dedication, things of this nature. Harry Potter has no chance of ever becoming an Auror! I will assist you in becoming an Auror if it the very last thing I do,  Potter!  I  will  coach you nightly in order to get the necessary grades! This  concludes  our  meeting,  Potter.",5,female
3310,UMBRIDGE, You think you could simply walk into my office without me knowing about it? Foolish boy!,5,female
3311,UMBRIDGE, Accio wand!,5,female
3312,UMBRIDGE, Who were you trying to contact?,5,female
3313,UMBRIDGE," Draco,  would  you  fetch  Professor Snape, please? Very well, Potter. I have been patient enough with you. You wished to see me?",5,female
3314,UMBRIDGE," I have just caught Potter trying to communicate with someone in my fire.  I  need  some Veritaserum. Truth  syrum. Well,  it  appears  that  I  cannot  help you. I have none. He's  got  Padfoot  at  the  place  it's hidden! What?  What  does  that  mean? Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at  me,  I  shall inform  you. We've played nicely, Potter. You leave me no choice! You could have saved me a lot of trouble if those Dementors I  sent to your house had finished you off! You sent the Dementors? Of course I did! Someone had to act!",5,female
3315,UMBRIDGE, CRUCIO!,5,female
3316,UMBRIDGE," Well,  well.",5,female
3317,UMBRIDGE," Shut up, Potter! Now talk, you silly girl! Who were you talking to?",5,female
3318,UMBRIDGE, Tell him?,5,female
3319,UMBRIDGE, You  and  Mr.  Potter  will  take  me  to it.,5,female
3320,UMBRIDGE," Much further, is it?",5,female
3321,UMBRIDGE, Your forest? This forest belongs to the  Ministry  of Magic!,5,female
3322,UMBRIDGE," Stay back, you beasts!",5,female
3323,UMBRIDGE, You cannot attack me! Any attack on a wizard by a half-breed--,5,female
3324,UMBRIDGE, Come no closer!,5,female
3325,UMBRIDGE, Incarcerus!,5,female
3326,UMBRIDGE, Ingrates!  Animals!  Filthy  half- bloods!,5,female
3339,BELLATRIX, Narcissa!,6,female
3340,BELLATRIX, Cissy!  You mustn’t do this.  He can’t be trusted.,6,female
3341,BELLATRIX, The Dark Lord is mistaken.,6,female
3342,BELLATRIX, Or so I believe.,6,female
3343,BELLATRIX, He lives in this Muggle dunghill?,6,female
3344,BELLATRIX, You must be joking.,6,female
3345,BELLATRIX, You?  The Dark Lord told you?,6,female
3346,BELLATRIX," You should feel honored, Cissy. As should Draco --",6,female
3347,BELLATRIX, Swear to it.,6,female
3348,BELLATRIX, Make the Unbreakable Vow. You see.  It’s just empty words. Oh he’ll try.  He’ll give it his best effort.  But when it matters most he’ll slither back into his hole.  Bloody coward...,6,female
3349,BELLATRIX," Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes.",6,female
3350,BELLATRIX," And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm?",6,female
3351,BELLATRIX," And should it prove necessary, if it seems Draco will fail... will you yourself carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?",6,female
3352,BELLATRIX," Well now, look what we have here. Dumbledore.  Wandless and alone.",6,female
3353,BELLATRIX," Love to, Albus.  But I’m afraid we’re on a bit of a tight schedule. Do it.",6,female
3354,BELLATRIX," No!  The Dark Lord was clear.  The boy’s to do it.  Go on, Draco. Now!",6,female
3355,BELLATRIX," Well, look who’s here.  Hogwarts own Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Come to see the slaughter?",6,female
3356,BELLATRIX, Boo.,6,female
3357,BELLATRIX, Draco!  Draco! They’ll kill you if you stay.,6,female
3919,GINNY, Hedwig...?  Mum!,6,female
3920,GINNY, Exactly.  How’d you guess?,6,female
3921,GINNY," I’m joking, Mum.",6,female
3922,GINNY, Now you’re joking.  I was only wondering when Harry got here.,6,female
3923,GINNY," Harry Dimpleton.  Harry Potter, of course.",6,female
3924,GINNY, Well his trunk’s in the kitchen. And his owl.,6,female
3925,GINNY," Me, nosy.  Is he up there with you?",6,female
3926,GINNY," Harry’s.  Haven’t seen him, have you?  Apparently, he’s wandering about the house.",6,female
3927,GINNY, Meaning?,6,female
3928,GINNY, None of your business.,6,female
3929,GINNY, Please.  What’s a Wrackspurt?,6,female
3930,GINNY, He’s covered in blood again.  Why is it he’s always covered in blood?,6,female
3931,GINNY, SHUT IT!,6,female
3932,GINNY," Piss off, Cormac.  How ‘bout I toss you a floater?",6,female
3933,GINNY, Who’s the Half-Blood Prince?,6,female
3934,GINNY, That’s what it says.  Right here. ‘This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.’,6,female
3935,GINNY," Sorry, I’m not ordinarily late --",6,female
3936,GINNY, What’s gotten into him?,6,female
3937,GINNY," Open up, you.",6,female
3938,GINNY, Don’t trust me?,6,female
3939,GINNY, ‘Course ‘tis.  Made them myself.,6,female
3940,GINNY, Everyone gone to bed?,6,female
3941,GINNY," I don’t sleep these days.  So I wash my hair.  Silly, right?",6,female
3942,GINNY," Happy Christmas, Harry.",6,female
3943,GINNY, Oh my god...,6,female
3944,GINNY," No, Harry!  It’s a trap!",6,female
3945,GINNY," ‘Bout time, don’t you think?",6,female
3946,GINNY, You have to get rid of it.  Today.,6,female
3947,GINNY, Take my hand.,6,female
3948,GINNY," Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they came.  Some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself.",6,female
3949,GINNY, Fred and George.  First year.  I hid Tom Riddle’s diary here for a time.  Wish I’d left it...,6,female
3950,GINNY," See, you never know what you’ll find up here.",6,female
3951,GINNY, All right.  Close your eyes.  That way you can’t be tempted.,6,female
3952,GINNY, There’s something else.  Another secret of sorts.  One of mine...,6,female
3953,GINNY," That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.",6,female
3954,MRS. WEASLEY," What is it, Ginny?  Is it your father?  Has something happened at the Ministry?  Has he been kidnapped?  Is it the Death Eaters?",6,female
3955,MRS. WEASLEY, You’re worse than Fred and George.,6,female
3956,MRS. WEASLEY, Harry who?,6,female
3957,MRS. WEASLEY," I think I’d know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn’t I?",6,female
3958,MRS. WEASLEY, I seriously doubt that.,6,female
3959,MRS. WEASLEY, But why didn’t you tell us you were coming?,6,female
3960,MRS. WEASLEY," That man.  But then, what would we do without him?  Ron!",6,female
3961,MRS. WEASLEY," Eat up, eat up, everyone!  There’s more to come!",6,female
3962,MRS. WEASLEY, You’re sure you won’t stay?,6,female
3963,MRS. WEASLEY, Remus...?,6,female
4058,HERMIONE, Was that an owl I heard?,6,female
4059,HERMIONE, Really?,6,female
4060,HERMIONE," A few days ago.  Though... for a bit, I wasn’t sure I was coming.",6,female
4061,HERMIONE, She’s not alone.  Even my parents -- and they’re Muggles -- know something bad is happening.,6,female
4062,HERMIONE, There’s been a lot of chatter lately.  That he’s gotten... old.,6,female
4063,HERMIONE, These are adorable.,6,female
4064,HERMIONE, How is it Fred and George are doing it?  Half the alley’s closed down.,6,female
4065,HERMIONE, Oh no.  Look.,6,female
4066,HERMIONE, But everyone got their wands from Ollivander.  Young.  Old...,6,female
4067,HERMIONE, Bloody hell.,6,female
4068,HERMIONE, I don’t know.,6,female
4069,HERMIONE," Stop, Harry, I know where you’re going with this --",6,female
4070,HERMIONE, Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.,6,female
4071,HERMIONE, I told you.  I don’t know what I saw.,6,female
4072,HERMIONE, Where’s Harry?,6,female
4073,HERMIONE, Will.  You.  Stop.  Eating!  Your best friend is missing!,6,female
4074,HERMIONE," Where’ve you been, Harry?  And what happened to your face?",6,female
4075,HERMIONE, What’s happened to his hand?,6,female
4076,HERMIONE," Granger, sir.  That one there is Veritaserum.  And that would be Polyjuice Potion.  And that...",6,female
4077,HERMIONE, ... is Amortentia!  The most powerful love potion in the world.,6,female
4078,HERMIONE, Liquid luck.,6,female
4079,HERMIONE, How did you do that?,6,female
4080,HERMIONE, No.  The instructions specifically say to cut.,6,female
4081,HERMIONE, Sh!,6,female
4082,HERMIONE, He’s vile.,6,female
4083,HERMIONE, No I have not.  And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.,6,female
4084,HERMIONE," I’d like to know just whose book that was.  Let’s take a look, shall we?",6,female
4085,HERMIONE, Why not?,6,female
4086,HERMIONE, The binding is fragile?,6,female
4087,HERMIONE," For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?",6,female
4088,HERMIONE," Well, I was curious.  So I went to --",6,female
4089,HERMIONE, And... nothing.  There’s no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.,6,female
4090,HERMIONE," What’ve you got there, Hagrid?",6,female
4091,HERMIONE," Stinksap?  You’re not sick, are you?",6,female
4092,HERMIONE," The Aurors.  I know they’re here to protect us, but... somehow I don’t feel any safer.",6,female
4093,HERMIONE," Three Butterbeers.  Splash of ginger in mine, please.",6,female
4094,HERMIONE," Oh, honestly, Ronald.  They’re just holding hands...",6,female
4095,HERMIONE, Leave?  You can’t be serious.,6,female
4096,HERMIONE, So?  What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me?  Would you expect her to get up and leave?,6,female
4097,HERMIONE," Be delighted, sir.",6,female
4098,HERMIONE, What’s up?,6,female
4099,HERMIONE, I’ll get someone --,6,female
4100,HERMIONE, My parents are dentists.  They tend to people’s teeth.,6,female
4101,HERMIONE," No.  Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches.",6,female
4102,HERMIONE, Look at her eyes.  They’ve been fighting again.  Her and Dean.,6,female
4103,HERMIONE, Nothing.,6,female
4104,HERMIONE, How was what?,6,female
4105,HERMIONE, Dead boring.  Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.,6,female
4106,HERMIONE," Ol’ Sluggy’s having a Christmas do, you know.  And we’re meant to bring someone...",6,female
4107,HERMIONE," Actually, I was going to ask you.",6,female
4108,HERMIONE, Really.  But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea --,6,female
4109,HERMIONE," Don’t drink that, Ron!",6,female
4110,HERMIONE, You could be expelled for that.,6,female
4111,HERMIONE, Ron seems to be enjoying himself.,6,female
4112,HERMIONE," You shouldn’t have done it, Harry.",6,female
4113,HERMIONE, That was different.  It was tryouts.  This was an actual match --,6,female
4114,HERMIONE, You didn’t put it in? Ron only thought you did?,6,female
4115,HERMIONE, Charms spell.  Just practicing.,6,female
4116,HERMIONE," How does it feel, Harry?  When you see Dean with Ginny? I know, Harry.  You’re my best friend.  I see how you look at her.",6,female
4117,HERMIONE, Oppugno!,6,female
4118,HERMIONE," He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.  I really couldn’t care less.  Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn’s Christmas party together?  Yes.  Of course, now, given the circumstances, I’ve had to make other arrangements.",6,female
4119,HERMIONE, Yes.  Why?,6,female
4120,HERMIONE, Why didn’t I think of that?,6,female
4121,HERMIONE," Um... it’s a surprise.  Besides, it’s you we need to worry about. And you can’t pick just anyone. See that girl over there.  That’s Romilda Vane.  Rumor has it she’s trying to slip you a love potion.",6,female
4122,HERMIONE," Hey!  She’s only interested in you because she thinks you’re the Chosen One.  You know that, right?",6,female
4123,HERMIONE," Hm?  Oh, I’ve just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac.  Under the mistletoe.",6,female
4124,HERMIONE, I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he’s a menace.  He’s got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.,6,female
4125,HERMIONE, No thank you.,6,female
4126,HERMIONE," On second thought -- maybe it’ll keep Cormac at bay.  Oh no, here he comes!",6,female
4127,HERMIONE," You have to realize who you are, Harry.",6,female
4128,HERMIONE, So tell me what Arthur said.,6,female
4129,HERMIONE, What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?,6,female
4130,HERMIONE," He looks different, don’t you think?  Draco.  Almost... ill.",6,female
4131,HERMIONE," Excuse me, I have to go vomit.",6,female
4132,HERMIONE," Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol’ Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One.",6,female
4133,HERMIONE," You’re going to have to persuade him somehow.  And now, I’m afraid, you’ve made it a lot harder.",6,female
4134,HERMIONE, That’s... not possible.  No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.,6,female
4135,HERMIONE, I might ask you the same.,6,female
4136,HERMIONE, I happen to be his... friend.,6,female
4137,HERMIONE," He’s been poisoned, you daft dimbo!  And for the record, I’ve always found him interesting.",6,female
4138,HERMIONE, Oh shut up.,6,female
4139,HERMIONE, Ron.  Stop.  You’re making it snow.,6,female
4140,HERMIONE," Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don’t believe it was a long conversation --",6,female
4141,HERMIONE," Does, doesn’t she?  And you say you don’t remember a thing from that night?  Not one thing?",6,female
4142,HERMIONE, Right.  Boggled...,6,female
4143,HERMIONE, That’s Katie.  That’s Katie Bell.,6,female
4144,HERMIONE, Well?  How do you feel?,6,female
4145,HERMIONE," Now remember.  Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office.",6,female
4146,HERMIONE," What?  No, Harry -- you’ve got to go see Slughorn.  We have a plan --",6,female
4147,HERMIONE, Harry.  It’s time.,6,female
4148,HERMIONE, If one wants it to be.  Why?,6,female
4149,HERMIONE," Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!",6,female
4150,HERMIONE, What if there are?,6,female
4151,HERMIONE, Do you think he would’ve done it. Draco?,6,female
4152,HERMIONE, Strange.  Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort’s soul...,6,female
4153,HERMIONE," ‘To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.  I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.  I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.  R.A.B.’ R.A.B.?",6,female
4154,HERMIONE," Ron’s okay with it, you know.  You and Ginny.  But if I were you, when he’s around, I’d keep the snogging to a minimum.",6,female
4155,HERMIONE, We reckoned -- Ron and me.,6,female
4156,HERMIONE," I’ve always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you’re really thick.",6,female
4157,HERMIONE," You don’t honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? You need us, Harry.",6,female
4158,HERMIONE, Like that’s going to happen.,6,female
4159,HERMIONE," Besides, he’s barking.",6,female
4160,HERMIONE," Yes, but I’m exceptionally perceptive.",6,female
4161,HERMIONE, Do you think we’ll ever... (come back?),6,female
4162,LUNA, Quibbler...?  Quibbler...?,6,female
4163,LUNA, There’s an article on Wrackspurts this month.  Quibbler...?,6,female
4164,LUNA," He’s lovely.  They’ve been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know. Quibbler?",6,female
4165,LUNA, They’re invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. Quibbler?  Quibbler?,6,female
4166,LUNA," Hello, Harry.",6,female
4167,LUNA, Wrackspurts.  Your head’s full of them.,6,female
4168,LUNA, It’s alright.  I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend.,6,female
4169,LUNA, That’s nice.,6,female
4170,LUNA, Who are those people?,6,female
4171,LUNA, Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way.  But it’s up to you.,6,female
4172,LUNA, No.  But I’ve done several toes and how different are they really?,6,female
4173,LUNA, Episkey.,6,female
4174,LUNA, Exceptionally ordinary.,6,female
4175,LUNA," Hello, everyone.  You look dreadful, Ron.",6,female
4176,LUNA, Is that why you just put something in his cup.  Is it a tonic?,6,female
4177,LUNA," I’ve never been to this part of the castle.  At least not while awake.  I sleepwalk, you see. It’s why I wear shoes to bed.",6,female
4202,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," History of Magic is up, ladies, not down.  Mr. Davies -- that’s the girl’s toilet...",6,female
4203,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Potter!,6,female
4204,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Enjoying ourself, are we?",6,female
4205,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, So I noticed.  I would think you’d want to fill it with Potions.  Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror?,6,female
4206,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with ‘Exceeds Expectations.’",6,female
4207,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Good.  And take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there.,6,female
4208,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," You’re sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks, Leanne?",6,female
4209,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Did she say to whom?,6,female
4210,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," All right, Leanne.  You may go. Why is it always you three?  Hm? When something happens?",6,female
4211,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Severus.,6,female
4212,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, What do you think?,6,female
4213,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Yes.  She was cursed.,6,female
4214,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," That’s a very serious accusation, Potter.",6,female
4215,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, I suggest you return to your dormitory.  All of you.,6,female
4216,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, I think we all agree that Mr. Potter’s actions were heroic.  The question is:  Why were they necessary.,6,female
4217,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, To your Houses.  No dawdling.,6,female
4218,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Potter.,6,female
4219,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Potter, in light of what’s happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone...",6,female
4220,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, You should know... Professor Dumbledore...,6,female
4221,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, You meant a great deal to him.,6,female
4287,HERMIONE," Coming, Mum.",7,female
4288,HERMIONE, Obliviate.,7,female
4289,HERMIONE, Goodbye.,7,female
4290,HERMIONE, I told you he’d take it well.,7,female
4291,HERMIONE," Harry, your eyesight really is awful.",7,female
4292,HERMIONE, Really?,7,female
4293,HERMIONE," We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --",7,female
4294,HERMIONE, To Harry!  It belongs to Harry! It chose him!  It came to him in the Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it!,7,female
4295,HERMIONE," Where is your guard, sir?",7,female
4296,HERMIONE, Ron!  Ron!,7,female
4297,HERMIONE, Shaftesbury Avenue.  I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad.  Just popped into my head.  I don’t know why...,7,female
4298,HERMIONE, This way!,7,female
4299,HERMIONE, We need to change.,7,female
4300,HERMIONE, Undetectable Extension Charm.,7,female
4301,HERMIONE, Always the tone of surprise.,7,female
4302,HERMIONE, That’ll be the books.,7,female
4303,HERMIONE," Ron’s right.  Cappuccino, please.",7,female
4304,HERMIONE," Too dangerous.  If Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.",7,female
4305,HERMIONE, I’ve had the essentials packed for days.  Just in case.,7,female
4306,HERMIONE, Petrificus Totalus!,7,female
4307,HERMIONE, Go.,7,female
4308,HERMIONE, Obliviate.,7,female
4309,HERMIONE, Maybe you still have the Trace on you.,7,female
4310,HERMIONE," We didn’t celebrate your birthday, Harry.  Ginny and I -- we’d prepared a cake.  We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding...",7,female
4311,HERMIONE, Right.  Perspective.,7,female
4312,HERMIONE," Mad-eye’s doing, I’d guess.  In case Snape decided to come snooping.",7,female
4313,HERMIONE, Homenum revelio.,7,female
4314,HERMIONE, It’s a spell to reveal human presence.,7,female
4315,HERMIONE, We’re alone.,7,female
4316,HERMIONE, Ron!  I’ve found him!,7,female
4317,HERMIONE," Harry, you can’t just disappear. We thought --",7,female
4318,HERMIONE, It’s from your Mum.  To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...?,7,female
4319,HERMIONE, Did she now?,7,female
4320,HERMIONE," Harry.  I can imagine why you’d want to go there, but... I don’t think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes.",7,female
4321,HERMIONE, Lovely.,7,female
4322,HERMIONE, Regulus Arcturus Black...?,7,female
4323,HERMIONE," Yes.  Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?",7,female
4324,HERMIONE, Maybe he knows.,7,female
4325,HERMIONE, But was it here?  Did you ever see it?,7,female
4326,HERMIONE, Ron!  RON!,7,female
4327,HERMIONE, They have flesh memories.,7,female
4328,HERMIONE," Snitches.  They’re never touched by bare skin until the Seeker captures it.  Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves.  That way, if there’s a dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it.",7,female
4329,HERMIONE," When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch -- that Dumbledore had hidden something in it.",7,female
4330,HERMIONE, Expelliarmus!,7,female
4331,HERMIONE, Stop lying!,7,female
4332,HERMIONE, You’ve still got it.,7,female
4333,HERMIONE," Well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt...",7,female
4334,HERMIONE, Remember what we said.  Keep your eyes down.  Don’t speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.  Act as normal as possible.  Just do what you see everyone else doing. We do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves inside. And then...,7,female
4335,HERMIONE, Correct.,7,female
4336,HERMIONE," Completely, utterly, without question.",7,female
4337,HERMIONE, Relashio!,7,female
4338,HERMIONE, Harry... they’ve seen you.  We’ve got to get out of here.,7,female
4339,HERMIONE," Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany.’",7,female
4340,HERMIONE, Quickly!,7,female
4341,HERMIONE, Unstopper it.,7,female
4342,HERMIONE, Just do it!,7,female
4343,HERMIONE," We were.  We were there.  But Yaxley had hold of me.  I knew we couldn’t stay once he’d seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got Splinched.  I’m... sorry.",7,female
4344,HERMIONE, It’s all I feel safe doing.,7,female
4345,HERMIONE, Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...,7,female
4346,HERMIONE," Protective enchantments.  I don’t fancy another visit like we had on Shaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent...",7,female
4347,HERMIONE, Repello Muggletum... Muffliato...,7,female
4348,HERMIONE, How’re the mushrooms?  Seem to be the only edible things growing round here.,7,female
4349,HERMIONE, Make sure to leave some for Ron.,7,female
4350,HERMIONE," He’ll be alright in a few days. Hopefully.  If we could take him to Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey --",7,female
4351,HERMIONE, So where do we go next?,7,female
4352,HERMIONE," It scares me a bit, that, thinking it’s a piece of Vol--",7,female
4353,HERMIONE, Dinner?,7,female
4354,HERMIONE, Tea?,7,female
4355,HERMIONE, I hate it.  It’s like he’s here with us.,7,female
4356,HERMIONE, Incendio!,7,female
4357,HERMIONE, Confringo!,7,female
4358,HERMIONE, What’re you doing?,7,female
4359,HERMIONE, I can put it in my bag --,7,female
4360,HERMIONE, I thought it had stopped.,7,female
4361,HERMIONE," You can’t let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it.  You have to close your mind.  It’s too dangerous --",7,female
4362,HERMIONE, Tell me.  What you saw.,7,female
4363,HERMIONE, The wandmaker?,7,female
4364,HERMIONE, Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch.  Most Durmstrang students did at one time.  What’s he got to do with You-Know-Who?,7,female
4365,HERMIONE, Don’t -- It... comforts him.,7,female
4366,HERMIONE, I think he just hopes he doesn’t hear bad news.  It gets him through the day.,7,female
4367,HERMIONE," We’ve all made sacrifices, Harry.",7,female
4368,HERMIONE, I don’t know.  It takes time.  I’m doing all I can.,7,female
4369,HERMIONE, Take it off.,7,female
4370,HERMIONE, Take it off.  Now.,7,female
4371,HERMIONE, Better?,7,female
4372,HERMIONE, It’s cold.  Even though it’s been lying against your skin for days.,7,female
4373,HERMIONE, We’ll take turns.  Okay?,7,female
4374,HERMIONE, He could smell it.  My perfume.,7,female
4375,HERMIONE, I told you.  Ron’s not strong enough to Apparate.,7,female
4376,HERMIONE, No one can conjure food out of thin air.  Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp’s Law.  The other four are --,7,female
4377,HERMIONE, Good plan.,7,female
4378,HERMIONE, None of us do.,7,female
4379,HERMIONE, I don’t like this place.,7,female
4380,HERMIONE, I want to go.,7,female
4381,HERMIONE, Oh my god...,7,female
4382,HERMIONE, I’ll tell you in a minute.,7,female
4383,HERMIONE, Alright.  The Sword of Gryffindor? It’s Goblin made.,7,female
4384,HERMIONE, You don’t understand.  Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger.,7,female
4385,HERMIONE," Harry.  You already destroyed one Horcrux, right?  Tom Riddle’s diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets.",7,female
4386,HERMIONE," Don’t you see!  In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor.",7,female
4387,HERMIONE, Exactly!  Which means...,7,female
4388,HERMIONE, Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.,7,female
4389,HERMIONE," Actually, I’m highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.",7,female
4390,HERMIONE, Ron...,7,female
4391,HERMIONE," Take it off, Ron.  Please take it off.  You wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it all day --",7,female
4392,HERMIONE," Harry, we weren’t --",7,female
4393,HERMIONE, I didn’t!  Not like that!  Harry -- I didn’t!,7,female
4394,HERMIONE, Stop!  Stop!,7,female
4395,HERMIONE, Me?,7,female
4396,HERMIONE," What?  Ron, no -- please --",7,female
4397,HERMIONE, He’s gone.,7,female
4398,HERMIONE, It’s a Muggle station.,7,female
4399,HERMIONE, ‘I open at the close?’,7,female
4400,HERMIONE," I don’t know.  But look, I’ve found something as well...",7,female
4401,HERMIONE," I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don’t think it is. It isn’t a rune and it’s not in Spellman’s Syllabary either.  And it’s been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn’t part of the book.",7,female
4402,HERMIONE, What d’you mean -- wearing it?,7,female
4403,HERMIONE, Why would someone have drawn it in a children’s book?,7,female
4404,HERMIONE, And it’s exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you.,7,female
4405,HERMIONE," It’s dangerous, Harry.  But I have to admit, recently even I’ve been thinking we might have to go.  I think it’s possible something else is hidden there. The sword.  If Dumbledore didn’t want it falling into the Ministry’s hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?",7,female
4406,HERMIONE," Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?",7,female
4407,HERMIONE, Don’t ever let me give you a haircut again.,7,female
4408,HERMIONE, I still think we should’ve used Polyjuice Potion.,7,female
4409,HERMIONE," Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve! Listen...",7,female
4410,HERMIONE, Yeah. I think they would.,7,female
4411,HERMIONE, Harry.,7,female
4412,HERMIONE, No.  But look.,7,female
4413,HERMIONE, Did you know he had a sister?,7,female
4414,HERMIONE, Lumos.,7,female
4415,HERMIONE," Ignotus... Hey, Har --",7,female
4416,HERMIONE," Happy Christmas, Harry.",7,female
4417,HERMIONE, Harry...,7,female
4418,HERMIONE, Someone’s watching us.  By the gate.,7,female
4419,HERMIONE, I don’t think this is a good idea.,7,female
4420,HERMIONE, Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave.,7,female
4421,HERMIONE, Omigod.  Harry...,7,female
4422,HERMIONE," Harry, I’m not sure about this.",7,female
4423,HERMIONE, There’s something odd about her. And what’s that smell?,7,female
4424,HERMIONE," You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot.",7,female
4425,HERMIONE, All right...,7,female
4426,HERMIONE, Why?,7,female
4427,HERMIONE, Harry...,7,female
4428,HERMIONE, Confringo!,7,female
4429,HERMIONE," The Forest of Dean.  I came here once with my mum and dad, years ago.  It’s just how I remember it. The trees.  The river.  It’s like nothing’s changed.  Not true, of course.  Everything’s changed.  If I brought my parents here, they wouldn’t recognize any of it.  Not the trees.  Not the river.  Not... me.",7,female
4430,HERMIONE," Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney, Australia.  They have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily.  No children.",7,female
4431,HERMIONE," Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.  Grow old.",7,female
4432,HERMIONE," You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.  Well, I know.",7,female
4433,HERMIONE," It was in Bathilda’s sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her. Harry, it doesn’t make for very nice reading --",7,female
4434,HERMIONE, Yes.,7,female
4435,HERMIONE, For a time.,7,female
4436,HERMIONE," Gellert Grindelwald.  He’s not very well known in Britain, but there was a time, before You-Know- Who...",7,female
4437,HERMIONE," When Grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from Durmstrang. He’d started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. A few teachers had always protected him, but they couldn’t anymore.  After he left, he traveled for awhile, then ended up in Godric’s Hollow where his great aunt lived, Bathilda Bagshot.",7,female
4438,HERMIONE," She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense.  Dumbledore’s mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they’d never really had anyone they could talk to on the same level.  They did a lot of talking that summer.  But they always returned to one particular subject.",7,female
4439,HERMIONE, Wizard rule over Muggles.,7,female
4440,HERMIONE, Yes.,7,female
4441,HERMIONE," It was something Dumbledore came up with.  He believed wizards were superior and should rule over Muggles, but gently, for their own good.  Grindelwald took a more violent position.",7,female
4442,HERMIONE," It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer.  Dumbledore was young --",7,female
4443,HERMIONE," He changed, Harry.  Years later, it was Dumbledore who put Grindelwald in prison.",7,female
4444,HERMIONE," It’s my fault.  As we were leaving Godric’s Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I’m sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different --",7,female
4445,HERMIONE, Maybe we can --,7,female
4446,HERMIONE," He loved you, Harry.  I know he loved you.",7,female
4447,HERMIONE, Everything all right?,7,female
4448,HERMIONE," You -- complete -- arse -- Ronald -- Weasley!  You crawl back here after all these weeks and say, ‘Hey?’ Where’s my wand?  Harry, where’s my wand!",7,female
4449,HERMIONE," Harry Potter, you give me my wand!",7,female
4450,HERMIONE, Never mind why he’s got my wand -- What is that?,7,female
4451,HERMIONE, You destroyed it?,7,female
4452,HERMIONE, And exactly how is it you have the Sword of Gryffindor?,7,female
4453,HERMIONE, Don’t think this changes anything.,7,female
4454,HERMIONE, See me doing what things?,7,female
4455,HERMIONE, What happened out there?,7,female
4456,HERMIONE, And what may I ask did I say?,7,female
4457,HERMIONE, What’s going on in there?,7,female
4458,HERMIONE, We need to talk.,7,female
4459,HERMIONE, I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.,7,female
4460,HERMIONE, See this?  It’s a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.  It’s the mark again.,7,female
4461,HERMIONE, It keeps cropping up.  Here.  In Beedle the Bard.  In the graveyard in Godric’s Hollow -- what?,7,female
4462,HERMIONE, Where?,7,female
4463,HERMIONE," Harry, you don’t have a clue where the next Horcrux is.  And neither do I.  But this, this means something.  I’m sure of it.",7,female
4464,HERMIONE, I’m always mad at him.,7,female
4465,HERMIONE, Do you see that?,7,female
4466,HERMIONE, No!  Don’t go near it!,7,female
4467,HERMIONE, It’s an Erumpent horn.  It’s a Class B Tradeable Material.,7,female
4468,HERMIONE," Where is Luna, sir?",7,female
4469,HERMIONE, It’s in here.,7,female
4470,HERMIONE," Granger.  Well... all right. There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight --",7,female
4471,HERMIONE," In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass...",7,female
4472,HERMIONE," Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows? That was the name on the grave with the mark on it in Godric’s Hollow.  Ignotus Peverell.",7,female
4473,HERMIONE," It’s obvious, isn’t it?",7,female
4474,HERMIONE, Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered.,7,female
4475,HERMIONE," Why the Stone, Harry?",7,female
4476,HERMIONE, But according to the story they don’t want to come back.  It’s all rubbish anyway.  There’s no such thing as the Deathly Hallows.,7,female
4477,HERMIONE, There have always been Cloaks --,7,female
4478,HERMIONE," Mr. Lovegood.  Thank you, sir --",7,female
4479,HERMIONE," No matter, sir.  We really ought to be go--",7,female
4480,HERMIONE, Ron!  Harry!  Take my hand!,7,female
4481,HERMIONE, What’re you saying?,7,female
4482,HERMIONE, Stop it!,7,female
4483,HERMIONE, Penelope Clearwater.  Half-blood.,7,female
4484,HERMIONE, A Stinging Jinx.,7,female
4485,HERMIONE, Not long.,7,female
5253,HERMIONE, A Stinging Jinx.,8,female
5254,HERMIONE, Not long.,8,female
5255,HERMIONE, I don’t know what you’re talking about.,8,female
5256,HERMIONE," Harry, are you thinking there’s a Horcrux in Bellatrix’s vault?",8,female
5257,HERMIONE, Positive.,8,female
5258,HERMIONE, Can’t I use the other?,8,female
5259,HERMIONE, But I hate that thing -- that’s the wand that killed Sirius!  How can I hold it and not feel...,8,female
5260,HERMIONE," It is, Harry.  Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why --",8,female
5261,HERMIONE," It’s perfect.  Thank you, Fleur.",8,female
5262,HERMIONE, He’s right.  I was being stupid.,8,female
5263,HERMIONE, It looks like it’s been down here forever.,8,female
5264,HERMIONE, That’s barbaric.  I...,8,female
5265,HERMIONE, Look.,8,female
5266,HERMIONE, No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.,8,female
5267,HERMIONE, It’s hot!,8,female
5268,HERMIONE," Ron, your foot!",8,female
5269,HERMIONE, How’re we going to reach it?,8,female
5270,HERMIONE, Harry!  Behind you!,8,female
5271,HERMIONE, In here!,8,female
5272,HERMIONE, We can’t just stand here!  Who’s got an idea?,8,female
5273,HERMIONE, I’ve got something.  But it’s mad.,8,female
5274,HERMIONE, Relashio!,8,female
5275,HERMIONE, It doesn’t realize it’s free! Leviosa!  Aviatus!  Ex Cappa!,8,female
5276,HERMIONE, When?,8,female
5277,HERMIONE, How is it you --,8,female
5278,HERMIONE," You let him in!  Harry, you can’t --",8,female
5279,HERMIONE, You saw it?,8,female
5280,HERMIONE, Tonight?  But we have to plan.  We have to figure out what --,8,female
5281,HERMIONE, They were ready for us.,8,female
5282,HERMIONE," No, you’ll give us away.",8,female
5283,HERMIONE, I know.,8,female
5284,HERMIONE, Harry!  I can see you!  In here!,8,female
5285,HERMIONE, Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?,8,female
5286,HERMIONE," That’s Ariana, isn’t it?  Your sister.  She’s beautiful.",8,female
5287,HERMIONE," She died very young, didn’t she.",8,female
5288,HERMIONE, Mr. Dumbledore... thank you.,8,female
5289,HERMIONE," Did save our lives twice.  Kept an eye on us in that mirror.  That doesn’t seem like someone who’s given up, does it?",8,female
5290,HERMIONE, She’s coming back!  And she’s got someone with her!,8,female
5291,HERMIONE, Neville...,8,female
5292,HERMIONE," How bad is it, Neville?  With Snape as Headmaster.",8,female
5293,HERMIONE, They did that to you?  But why?,8,female
5294,HERMIONE, Unless we can destroy it.,8,female
5295,HERMIONE, You were thinking.  It’s Ron’s idea.  And it’s brilliant.,8,female
5296,HERMIONE, Where are you going?,8,female
5297,HERMIONE, No.  Of course not.,8,female
5298,HERMIONE, I’m scared.,8,female
5299,HERMIONE, I didn’t expect it to be like this.,8,female
5300,HERMIONE, Not this.,8,female
5301,HERMIONE, There he is.,8,female
5302,HERMIONE, He vanished.  Just now.  I saw it.,8,female
5303,HERMIONE, That’s right.  I did.,8,female
5304,HERMIONE, Brilliant.,8,female
5305,HERMIONE, Did you see where it went?  The diadem!,8,female
5306,HERMIONE, Do we climb!,8,female
5307,HERMIONE, C’mon!  This way!,8,female
5308,HERMIONE, Someplace safe.,8,female
5309,HERMIONE, NO!,8,female
5310,HERMIONE, Where is everyone?,8,female
5311,HERMIONE, Where’ve you been?,8,female
5312,HERMIONE," What is it, Harry?  What is it you know?",8,female
5313,HERMIONE, I’ll go with you.  I’ll --,8,female
5314,HERMIONE, Yes!,8,female
5315,HERMIONE, I don’t want you to say anything you wouldn’t say if we weren’t about to be killed by a giant snake!  It’ll just ruin it!,8,female
5316,HERMIONE, What’s the matter with her?,8,female
5317,HERMIONE, Can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.,8,female
5318,HERMIONE, Something my mum used to say.,8,female
5319,HERMIONE, Why didn’t it work for him?  The Elder wand.,8,female
5320,HERMIONE, We?,8,female
5321,BELLATRIX, Show me.,8,female
5322,BELLATRIX, Get Draco.,8,female
5323,BELLATRIX," Just sit back and watch, Lucius. Hm?  Pour yourself another glass of wine.",8,female
5324,BELLATRIX, Where’d you find them?,8,female
5325,BELLATRIX," Lovely scarf, Scabior.  Though I’m not sure it’s your color.",8,female
5326,BELLATRIX, You don’t say.,8,female
5327,BELLATRIX," Fancy her, do you, Scabior?  Can’t say I blame you.  Maybe we’ll work out a little reward for you, hm? That is, assuming all is as it appears.  Ah, Draco.  Come here, darling.",8,female
5328,BELLATRIX," My friends here say they’ve got Harry Potter.  Seeing as he’s an old school chum of yours, I thought you could confirm the fact for us.",8,female
5329,BELLATRIX, Well...?,8,female
5330,BELLATRIX, Of course not. Narcissa.  Tend to your husband.,8,female
5331,BELLATRIX," Don’t be shy, sweetheart.  Get up nice and close.",8,female
5332,BELLATRIX," What is wrong with his face, Scabior?",8,female
5333,BELLATRIX, Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.,8,female
5334,BELLATRIX," Was it you, dearie?  Give me her wand.  We’ll see what the last spell was.",8,female
5335,BELLATRIX, What is that?,8,female
5336,BELLATRIX, Where did you get that!,8,female
5337,BELLATRIX, Go.  GO!,8,female
5338,BELLATRIX, Wormtail.  Put these two in the cellar.  I want to have a little conversation with this one.  Girl to girl.,8,female
5339,BELLATRIX, This sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts.  How did you get it?,8,female
5340,BELLATRIX, Liar.  What else did you take?,8,female
5341,BELLATRIX, Well?,8,female
5342,BELLATRIX, Perhaps it just walked out on its own then.,8,female
5343,BELLATRIX, Liar!  You can’t deceive me!,8,female
5344,BELLATRIX," Consider yourself lucky, Goblin. The same won’t be said for this one.",8,female
5345,BELLATRIX, Stop or she dies!,8,female
5346,BELLATRIX, Drop your wands.,8,female
5347,BELLATRIX, I said drop them!,8,female
5348,BELLATRIX," Pick them up, Draco.  Now!  Well, well, look what we have here. Harry Potter.  All bright, shiny and new again.  Just in time for the Dark Lord.",8,female
5349,BELLATRIX," Call him, Draco.",8,female
5350,BELLATRIX, You dirty little monkey!  You could have killed me!,8,female
5351,BELLATRIX," For God’s sake, Cissy, you’ve got a wand!  Use it!",8,female
5352,BELLATRIX, How dare you take a witch’s wand. How dare you defy your masters.,8,female
5353,BELLATRIX," My lord, let me help you --",8,female
5354,BELLATRIX, The boy.  Is he dead?,8,female
5355,BELLATRIX, Someone has to do the washing.,8,female
5356,BELLATRIX," Come on, granny, give us your best.",8,female
5357,BELLATRIX, Be thankful we only took one. Besides... It’s not like you don’t have a spare.,8,female
5462,LUNA, Ron?  Harry...?,8,female
5463,LUNA," You look strange, Harry.  Mr. Ollivander, look who’s here.  It’s Harry Potter.",8,female
5464,LUNA," You’re bleeding, Harry.",8,female
5465,LUNA, That’s a curious thing to hide in your sock.,8,female
5466,LUNA," You were hiding it, weren’t you?",8,female
5467,LUNA," Of course. Whenever you’re ready, sir.",8,female
5468,LUNA, We should close his eyes.  Don’t you think?,8,female
5469,LUNA, There.  Now he could be sleeping.,8,female
5470,LUNA, Harry.  It’s all right.  That it hurts.  That’s what reminds us how lucky we are to be alive.,8,female
5471,LUNA, It’s beautiful here.,8,female
5472,LUNA, Muggles think these keep evil away.  But they’re wrong...,8,female
5473,LUNA, My father used to say that when a child died.,8,female
5474,LUNA, Funny how Mr. Dobby knew exactly where to find us.,8,female
5475,LUNA," I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That’s why we don’t need to talk about it.",8,female
5476,LUNA, Neither am I.,8,female
5477,LUNA," Well, there’s Rowena Ravenclaw’s lost diadem.",8,female
5478,LUNA, The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn’t anyone ever heard of it? It’s quite famous.,8,female
5479,LUNA, Harry!  Wait!  I need to talk to you!,8,female
5480,LUNA, But you won’t find anything where you’re going.  You’re wasting your time.,8,female
5481,LUNA, Harry --,8,female
5482,LUNA, HARRY POTTER!  YOU LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW!,8,female
5483,LUNA, Don’t you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw’s diadem: ‘There’s not a person alive who’s seen it.’,8,female
5484,LUNA," It’s obvious, isn’t it?  We have to talk to someone who’s dead.",8,female
5485,LUNA," He’s very impressive, isn’t he?",8,female
5486,LUNA," If you’re to find her, you’ll find her down there.",8,female
5487,LUNA, No.  I think it best if you two talk alone.  She’s very shy.,8,female
5488,LUNA, Thanks.,8,female
5644,GINNY, Harry.,8,female
5645,GINNY, Snape knows.  He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.,8,female
5646,GINNY, Ready!?,8,female
5647,GINNY, What?,8,female
5648,GINNY, Mad.  The both of you.,8,female
5649,GINNY, I know.,8,female
5650,GINNY, It’s all right.  We’re going to get you inside.,8,female
5651,GINNY, Don’t worry.  I won’t leave you. I promise.,8,female
5652,GINNY, ... Hagrid’s carrying?,8,female
5653,GINNY," Neville, who is that?",8,female
5654,GINNY, No... NO!,8,female
5693,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Coward!  COWARD!  And he didn’t even stay to fight! Mr. Potter, do you mind telling me what you’re doing here, which, I trust you realize, is an act of complete and utter lunacy?",8,female
5694,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, I thought it might have something to do with that. All right!  Settle down!  Settle down!,8,female
5695,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," It appears that your Headmaster, to use the common phrase, has done a bunk.",8,female
5696,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Potter...,8,female
5697,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," They’re supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot!",8,female
5698,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," Wait!  As it turns out, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune. If you would, I’d like you to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House from the Hall.",8,female
5699,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, The dungeons should do.,8,female
5700,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter.  What is it you need?",8,female
5701,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Do what you have to do.  I’ll secure the castle.,8,female
5702,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," We teachers are rather good at magic, Potter.  We’ve even been known to turn out a worthwhile witch or wizard on occasion.",8,female
5703,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," By the way, Potter... It’s good to see you.",8,female
5704,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," That is correct, Longbottom.",8,female
5705,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Boom.,8,female
5706,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Why don’t you confer with Mr. Finnegan.,8,female
5707,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, That’s the spirit.  Now off you go.,8,female
5708,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL," That doesn’t mean we can’t hold him up.  And his name is Voldemort, Filius.  You might as well use it.  He’s going to try to kill you either way.",8,female
5709,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Piertotum Locomotor!,8,female
5710,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Hogwarts is threatened!  Man the boundaries and protect us!  Do your duty to our school!,8,female
5711,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, I’ve always wanted to use that spell.,8,female
5712,PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, Fall inside!  Everybody!  Fall inside!,8,female
0,DUMBLEDORE, I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.,1,male
1,DUMBLEDORE," I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.",1,male
2,DUMBLEDORE, Hagrid is bringing him.,1,male
3,DUMBLEDORE," No problems, I trust, Hagrid?",1,male
4,DUMBLEDORE, The only family he has.,1,male
5,DUMBLEDORE, Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.,1,male
6,DUMBLEDORE," There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all.",1,male
7,DUMBLEDORE, Good luck...Harry Potter.,1,male
8,DUMBLEDORE," I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.",1,male
9,DUMBLEDORE, Let the feast...begin.,1,male
10,DUMBLEDORE," SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.",1,male
11,DUMBLEDORE," Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.",1,male
12,DUMBLEDORE," Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}",1,male
13,DUMBLEDORE," Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?",1,male
14,DUMBLEDORE," What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.",1,male
15,DUMBLEDORE, Fine. They're both just fine.,1,male
16,DUMBLEDORE," Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.",1,male
17,DUMBLEDORE," {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.",1,male
18,DUMBLEDORE," Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}",1,male
19,DUMBLEDORE," Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.",1,male
20,DUMBLEDORE," Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax.",1,male
21,DUMBLEDORE," Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.",1,male
22,DUMBLEDORE," Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}",1,male
23,DUMBLEDORE," Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}",1,male
24,DUMBLEDORE," And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.",1,male
25,DUMBLEDORE," Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!",1,male
57,HAGRID," Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.",1,male
58,HAGRID," No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.",1,male
59,HAGRID, Sorry 'bout that. {He puts the door back up},1,male
60,HAGRID," Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. {The gun fires}",1,male
61,HAGRID," {sees Dudley} Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!",1,male
62,HAGRID," Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. {Hands Harry the cake} Words and all. Heh.",1,male
63,HAGRID," It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?",1,male
64,HAGRID," Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.",1,male
65,HAGRID," No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?",1,male
66,HAGRID," You're a wizard, Harry.",1,male
67,HAGRID," Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry softens his expression} Ah.",1,male
68,HAGRID, A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?,1,male
69,HAGRID, It's an outrage! It's a scandal!,1,male
70,HAGRID," Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?",1,male
71,HAGRID, {whips out umbrella and points it at Vernon} Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.,1,male
72,HAGRID," Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.",1,male
73,HAGRID," {checks a clock} Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm? {Leaves}",1,male
74,HAGRID, If you know where to go.,1,male
75,HAGRID," No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.",1,male
76,HAGRID," Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.",1,male
77,HAGRID," Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.",1,male
78,HAGRID," See, Harry, you're famous!",1,male
79,HAGRID," I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. {Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street.}",1,male
80,HAGRID," Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.",1,male
81,HAGRID," Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.",1,male
82,HAGRID," They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.",1,male
83,HAGRID," Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}",1,male
84,HAGRID," Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?",1,male
85,HAGRID," Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.",1,male
86,HAGRID," Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.",1,male
87,HAGRID," A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.",1,male
88,HAGRID, Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! {Has a snowy owl in a cage which hoots.},1,male
89,HAGRID," You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.",1,male
90,HAGRID," {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...",1,male
91,HAGRID," No, I can't spell it. All right. His name was Voldemort.",1,male
92,HAGRID, Shh!!,1,male
93,HAGRID," It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}",1,male
94,HAGRID," Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.",1,male
95,HAGRID," Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.",1,male
96,HAGRID," What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.",1,male
97,HAGRID," Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!",1,male
98,HAGRID," Hello, Harry.",1,male
99,HAGRID," Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.",1,male
100,HAGRID, Well done!,1,male
101,HAGRID, What's going on with Harry's broomstick?,1,male
102,HAGRID, Go go go!,1,male
103,HAGRID, Looks like he's gonna be sick!,1,male
104,HAGRID, Yes!,1,male
105,HAGRID, Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?,1,male
106,HAGRID, Who told you 'bout Fluffy?,1,male
107,HAGRID," Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the",1,male
108,HAGRID," Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.",1,male
109,HAGRID, Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.,1,male
110,HAGRID," {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.",1,male
111,HAGRID, I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.},1,male
112,HAGRID," {clad in oven mitts and an apron} Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. {Closes door.}",1,male
113,HAGRID, Oh.,1,male
114,HAGRID," Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?",1,male
115,HAGRID, Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!,1,male
116,HAGRID," You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.",1,male
117,HAGRID," That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.",1,male
118,HAGRID, That? It's a ... its um...,1,male
119,HAGRID," I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.",1,male
120,HAGRID," Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}",1,male
121,HAGRID," Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?",1,male
122,HAGRID," Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede.",1,male
123,HAGRID," Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}",1,male
124,HAGRID," Oh, dear.",1,male
125,HAGRID, {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.,1,male
126,HAGRID," Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.",1,male
127,HAGRID, Right. Let's go.,1,male
128,HAGRID," What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.",1,male
129,HAGRID," And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}",1,male
130,HAGRID," Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}",1,male
131,HAGRID," Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}",1,male
132,HAGRID, I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.,1,male
133,HAGRID," Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.""",1,male
134,HAGRID," Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.""",1,male
135,HAGRID, I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!,1,male
136,HAGRID, Yes! {grins},1,male
137,HAGRID," Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.",1,male
138,HAGRID," Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? {Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.} This is for you.",1,male
139,HAGRID," Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.",1,male
140,HAGRID," I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go.",1,male
154,DUDLEY," Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!",1,male
155,DUDLEY, How many are there?,1,male

163,DUDLEY," Mum, mummy!",1,male
164,DUDLEY," Mum, help! Help me!",1,male
165,DUDLEY," {Sees Harrys letter. He runs and grabs it} Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!!",1,male
166,DUDLEY, AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! {He jumps on Petunias lap},1,male
167,DUDLEY, What is it? Please tell me what's happening!,1,male
168,DUDLEY," Daddy's gone mad, hasnt he?!",1,male
169,DUDLEY, I-I-I'm not Harry.,1,male

172,VERNON," Happy birthday, son.",1,male
173,VERNON," Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!",1,male
174,VERNON, Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.,1,male
175,VERNON," Yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year!",1,male
176,VERNON," I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.",1,male
177,VERNON, Move!,1,male
178,VERNON, What happened?,1,male
179,VERNON, {Scoffs and shoves Harry into the closet} There's no such thing as magic!,1,male
180,VERNON," Ah, Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.",1,male
181,VERNON, {Laughs} Yours? Who'd be writing to you?,1,male
182,VERNON, No more mail through this letterbox.,1,male
183,VERNON, Shoo! Go on!,1,male
184,VERNON," Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?",1,male
185,VERNON," Go away, ahh!",1,male
186,VERNON, Give me that! Give me that letter!,1,male
187,VERNON, Ahh!,1,male
188,VERNON, That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!,1,male
189,VERNON, Who's there? Ahh!,1,male
190,VERNON," I demand that you leave at once, Sir! You are breaking and entering!",1,male
191,VERNON, Hell not be going! We swore when we took him in wed put an end to this rubbish!,1,male
192,VERNON, He'll not be going!,1,male
193,VERNON, I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!,1,male
194,HARRY," Yes, Aunt Petunia.",1,male
195,HARRY," Yes, Uncle Vernon.",1,male
196,HARRY, He's asleep!,1,male
197,HARRY," Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.",1,male
198,HARRY," Can you...hear me? {The snake nods} It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? {The snake shakes its head} You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? {The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity} I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.",1,male
199,HARRY, Anytime.,1,male
200,HARRY, {Grins and giggles},1,male
201,HARRY, Ow!,1,male
202,HARRY, I swear I don't know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!,1,male
203,HARRY," Hey, give it back! It's mine!",1,male
204,HARRY," {Hands cookie to Vernon} Because there's no post on Sunday? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir. {Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.} No sir, not one blasted, miserable---",1,male
205,HARRY, Get off! Ahh!,1,male
206,HARRY, They're my letters! Let go of me!,1,male
207,HARRY," Make a wish, Harry. {Blows}",1,male
208,HARRY," {puts cake down} Excuse me, who are you?",1,male
209,HARRY," Sorry, no.",1,male
210,HARRY, Learnt what?,1,male
211,HARRY, I-I'm a what?,1,male
212,HARRY," A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.",1,male
213,HARRY," No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.",1,male
214,HARRY," Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!",1,male
215,HARRY, You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me?,1,male
216,HARRY, Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!,1,male
217,HARRY, Muggle?,1,male
218,HARRY, {laughs},1,male
219,HARRY, {Nods} Okay.,1,male
220,HARRY," All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London?",1,male
221,HARRY," Oh, nice to meet you. {Puts out hand. Quirrell refuses}",1,male
222,HARRY, Good-bye.,1,male
223,HARRY," But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?",1,male
224,HARRY," But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.",1,male
225,HARRY," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?",1,male
226,HARRY," What's in there, Hagrid?",1,male
227,HARRY, I still need...a wand.,1,male
228,HARRY, {Softly} Hello? Hello?,1,male
229,HARRY, Oh! {waves. All the shelves come crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.},1,male
230,HARRY," Sorry, but what's curious?",1,male
231,HARRY, And...who owned that wand?,1,male
232,HARRY, Wow.,1,male
233,HARRY," He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.",1,male
234,HARRY, Maybe if you wrote it down?,1,male
235,HARRY, Voldemort?,1,male
236,HARRY, Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?,1,male
237,HARRY, What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?,1,male
238,HARRY," Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}",1,male
239,HARRY," Excuse me, excuse me.",1,male
240,HARRY," Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?",1,male
241,HARRY, Muggles?,1,male
242,HARRY, Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to,1,male
243,HARRY," No, not at all.",1,male
244,HARRY, I'm Harry. Harry Potter.,1,male
245,HARRY, The what?,1,male
246,HARRY," Oh, yeah. {lifts up hair}",1,male
247,HARRY, {pulls out coins} We'll take the lot!,1,male
248,HARRY, Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?,1,male
249,HARRY," {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?",1,male
250,HARRY," Hey, I got Dumbledore!",1,male
251,HARRY," Hey, he's gone!",1,male
252,HARRY, Just a little bit.,1,male
253,HARRY, Yeah!,1,male
254,HARRY," Hey, Hagrid.",1,male
255,HARRY," I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.",1,male
256,HARRY, Ahh! {puts hand on forehead},1,male
257,HARRY," Nothing...it's nothing, I'm fine.",1,male
258,HARRY, {whispers} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.,1,male
259,HARRY, Wow.,1,male
260,HARRY," Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?",1,male
261,HARRY, What's he teach?,1,male
262,HARRY, I think she fancies you.,1,male
263,HARRY, We got lost.,1,male

265,HARRY," I don't know, Sir.",1,male
266,HARRY, What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?,1,male
267,HARRY, Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.,1,male
268,HARRY," Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.",1,male
269,HARRY, Whoa. {Hermione stares as the class continues.},1,male
270,HARRY, Neville! {shouting},1,male
271,HARRY," Give it here, Malfoy.",1,male
272,HARRY," Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!",1,male
273,HARRY," A century, according to McGonagall.",1,male
274,HARRY, But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?,1,male
275,HARRY, I-I didn't know.,1,male
276,HARRY, Who doesn't?,1,male
277,HARRY, What's happening?,1,male
278,HARRY, {taps Ron} Let's go this way.,1,male
279,HARRY, Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?,1,male
280,HARRY, Let's go.,1,male
281,HARRY, Run!,1,male
282,HARRY, It's locked!,1,male
283,HARRY," And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}",1,male
284,HARRY, Guarding something?,1,male
285,HARRY, {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.},1,male
286,HARRY, I like this ball.,1,male
287,HARRY, What do I do with it?,1,male
288,HARRY, Whoa.,1,male
289,HARRY," I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.",1,male
290,HARRY, I think she heard you.,1,male
291,HARRY, Where's Hermione?,1,male
292,HARRY, How could a troll get in?,1,male
293,HARRY, Hermione! She doesn't know!,1,male
294,HARRY, He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!,1,male
295,HARRY," Hermione, move!",1,male
296,HARRY," Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}",1,male
297,HARRY," Whoa, whoa whoa!",1,male
298,HARRY, Do something! {swipe},1,male
299,HARRY, Anything! Hurry up!,1,male
300,HARRY, I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.,1,male
301,HARRY, I'm not hungry.,1,male
302,HARRY, That explains the blood.,1,male
303,HARRY," Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.",1,male
304,HARRY," The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.",1,male
305,HARRY, That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.,1,male
306,HARRY, But I-I never get mail.,1,male
307,HARRY, It's a broomstick!,1,male
308,HARRY, But who...?,1,male
309,HARRY, A little bit.,1,male
310,HARRY, What happened?,1,male
311,HARRY, Yes! {a bludger zooms by him.} Whoa!,1,male
312,HARRY, Yes!,1,male
313,HARRY, Whoa! Whooa!,1,male
314,HARRY, Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?,1,male
315,HARRY, Yes?,1,male
316,HARRY," But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!",1,male
317,HARRY, Exactly.,1,male
318,HARRY, Nicholas Flamel?,1,male
319,HARRY, Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?,1,male
320,HARRY, Knight to E-5.,1,male
321,HARRY," Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?",1,male
322,HARRY, I've got presents?,1,male
323,HARRY, Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.},1,male
324,HARRY," ""Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.""",1,male
325,HARRY, Some kind of...cloak.,1,male
326,HARRY, My body's gone!,1,male
327,HARRY, I'm invisible??,1,male
328,HARRY," {comes over} There was no name. It just said, ""Use it well.""",1,male
329,HARRY, {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?,1,male
330,HARRY," Mum? {the woman nods and smiles} Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.",1,male
331,HARRY," Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! {pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!",1,male
332,HARRY," There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!",1,male
333,HARRY," Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!",1,male
334,HARRY," {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad",1,male
335,HARRY, How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.},1,male
336,HARRY," So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?",1,male
337,HARRY, Shh!,1,male
338,HARRY, Hagrid!,1,male
339,HARRY, We think Snape's trying to steal it.,1,male
340,HARRY," Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.",1,male
341,HARRY, What?,1,male
342,HARRY," Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?",1,male
343,HARRY," Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?",1,male
344,HARRY, Norbert?,1,male
345,HARRY, Malfoy.,1,male
346,HARRY, Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.,1,male
347,HARRY, I don't understand. Is that bad?,1,male
348,HARRY, 50?!,1,male
349,HARRY," Hagrid, what's that?",1,male
350,HARRY," If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.",1,male
351,HARRY," What is it, Fang?",1,male
352,HARRY, {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?,1,male
353,HARRY, But who would choose such a life?,1,male
354,HARRY, Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?,1,male
355,HARRY, The Philosopher's Stone.,1,male
356,HARRY," But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}",1,male
357,HARRY," I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.",1,male
358,HARRY, My scar. It keeps burning.,1,male
359,HARRY, Not like this.,1,male
360,HARRY," I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}",1,male
361,HARRY," Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?",1,male
362,HARRY," The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.",1,male
363,HARRY, And did he seem interested in Fluffy?,1,male
364,HARRY," We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!",1,male
365,HARRY, He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.,1,male
366,HARRY, Someone's going to try and steal it.,1,male
367,HARRY," That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.",1,male
368,HARRY, We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.,1,male
369,HARRY, Trevor.,1,male
370,HARRY," Now, Neville, listen. We were",1,male
371,HARRY, Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.,1,male
372,HARRY, Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.},1,male
373,HARRY, We have to move its paw.,1,male
374,HARRY," Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?",1,male
375,HARRY, Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.},1,male
376,HARRY, Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.},1,male
377,HARRY, Hermione! Where are you?!,1,male
378,HARRY," Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.",1,male
379,HARRY, Apparently not.,1,male
380,HARRY, What?,1,male
381,HARRY," Ron, are you okay?",1,male
382,HARRY, Okay.,1,male
383,HARRY, Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.,1,male
384,HARRY, I don't know. Sounds like wings.,1,male
385,HARRY," They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}",1,male
386,HARRY, I don't know. Strange.,1,male
387,HARRY, There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.},1,male
388,HARRY, It's too simple.,1,male
389,HARRY, Catch the key!,1,male
390,HARRY, Where are we? A graveyard.,1,male
391,HARRY, There's the door.,1,male
392,HARRY, Wait a minute.,1,male
393,HARRY," No, Ron! No!",1,male
394,HARRY, He's going to sacrifice himself!,1,male
395,HARRY," RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.",1,male
396,HARRY, Not as good as you.,1,male
397,HARRY, You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one,1,male
398,HARRY," B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.",1,male
399,HARRY, Snape was trying to...save me?,1,male
400,HARRY, Th-then you let the troll in.,1,male
401,HARRY, I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.,1,male
402,HARRY, Voldemort.,1,male
403,HARRY, {shakes his head} Never!,1,male
404,HARRY, You liar!,1,male
405,HARRY," Ahhhhhhhhh! {Voldemort flies away. Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in an outstretched hand.}",1,male
406,HARRY, Admirers?,1,male
407,HARRY, Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?,1,male
408,HARRY," But, what happened to the Stone?",1,male
409,HARRY," But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?",1,male
410,HARRY," How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...",1,male
411,HARRY," Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?",1,male
412,HARRY, What is it?,1,male
413,HARRY," All right there, Ron?",1,male
414,HARRY, {shrug} All right. Hermione?,1,male
415,HARRY, {Pats} Good job.,1,male
416,HARRY, One minute. {He walks over to Hagrid.},1,male
417,HARRY," Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}",1,male
418,HARRY," But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.",1,male
419,HARRY, I'm not going home. Not really.,1,male
420,QUIRRELL, Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.,1,male
421,QUIRRELL," F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.",1,male
422,QUIRRELL," Oh. Y-yes, of course. {a boy, OLIVER WOOD, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.} And the vampire b-bat...{eerie roar.}",1,male
423,QUIRRELL, TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! {stops and there is utter silence.} Thought you ought to know. {falls over in a dead faint.},1,male
424,QUIRRELL, Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. {Exit Ron and Harry and Hermione.} {Troll roars.} Ahh! Hehe....,1,male
425,QUIRRELL, Severus...I-I thought...,1,male
426,QUIRRELL, W-what do you m-mean?,1,male
427,QUIRRELL," Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, ""p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?""",1,male
428,QUIRRELL," No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.",1,male
429,QUIRRELL, I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.,1,male
430,QUIRRELL," Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry's scar hurts.} But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?",1,male
431,QUIRRELL," Come here, Potter, now!",1,male
432,QUIRRELL, Tell me. What do you see?,1,male
433,QUIRRELL, What is it?! What do you see?!,1,male
434,QUIRRELL, Tell the truth! What do you see?!,1,male
435,QUIRRELL," Master, you are not strong enough.",1,male
436,QUIRRELL, Ahh! Ahh! {backs up. His hand is crumbling into a mountain of black ash.} What is this magic? {hand dissipates.},1,male
437,QUIRRELL," {Walks forward, but Harry puts both hands on his face.} Ahhhhhhhhhh!",1,male
438,RON," Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.",1,male
439,RON," {sits across from Harry} I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.",1,male
440,RON," So-so it's true?! I mean, do you really have the...the...",1,male
441,RON, {whispers} Scar...?,1,male
442,RON, Wicked.,1,male
443,RON," {Holds up mushed sandwiches} No, thanks, I'm all set. {smacks lips.}",1,male
444,RON, Whoa!,1,male
445,RON," They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!",1,male
446,RON," It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.",1,male
447,RON," Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.",1,male
448,RON, I got about 6 of him.,1,male
449,RON," Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?",1,male
450,RON, Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?,1,male
451,RON, {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-,1,male
452,RON, No.,1,male
453,RON," Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!",1,male
454,RON, {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.,1,male
455,RON, Whoaa!,1,male
456,RON, Wicked.,1,male
457,RON," Mental that one, I'm telling you.",1,male
458,RON, There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.,1,male
459,RON," Harry, what is it?",1,male
460,RON, {Sighs},1,male
461,RON, Ahh!,1,male
462,RON," Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!",1,male
463,RON, Ahh!,1,male
464,RON," Look at that one, Harry!",1,male
465,RON," Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?",1,male
466,RON, That was bloody brilliant.,1,male
467,RON," Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...",1,male
468,RON, Ah. Mail's here!,1,male
469,RON," Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}",1,male
470,RON, Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in,1,male
471,RON," Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.",1,male
472,RON," Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! {Hermione jumps up from her work and comes to join them.}",1,male
473,RON," Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.",1,male
474,RON," I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.",1,male
475,RON, Ahh!,1,male
476,RON," Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}",1,male
477,RON, It's Filch's cat!,1,male
478,RON," That's it, we're done for!",1,male
479,RON, Alohomora?,1,male
480,RON, Probably thinks this door's locked.,1,male
481,RON, What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.,1,male
482,RON," I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}",1,male
483,RON, She needs to sort out her priorities!,1,male
484,RON, Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.},1,male
485,RON," You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.",1,male
486,RON," It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!",1,male
487,RON," Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?",1,male
488,RON," Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}",1,male
489,RON, Ew.,1,male
490,RON, What? {swipe},1,male
491,RON," Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.",1,male
492,RON, Let's open it.,1,male
493,RON," Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!",1,male
494,RON, Jinxing the broom? What do we do?,1,male
495,RON," Come on, Hermione!",1,male
496,RON, Go!,1,male
497,RON, Fluffy?,1,male
498,RON, Queen to E-5.,1,male
499,RON, That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.,1,male
500,RON," Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!",1,male
501,RON, We've looked a hundred times!,1,male
502,RON, I think we've had a bad influence on her.,1,male
503,RON," {calling from downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!",1,male
504,RON," Happy Christmas, Harry.",1,male
505,RON," Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!",1,male
506,RON, Yeah!,1,male
507,RON, There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.},1,male
508,RON, What is it?,1,male
509,RON," Well, let's see then. Put it on.",1,male
510,RON, Whoa!,1,male
511,RON, I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!,1,male
512,RON, {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.,1,male
513,RON, Why?,1,male
514,RON, I only see me.,1,male
515,RON," That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?",1,male
516,RON, This is light?,1,male
517,RON, Immortal?,1,male
518,RON, I know what it means!,1,male
519,RON," I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?",1,male
520,RON, That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.,1,male
521,RON, {laughs},1,male
522,RON," It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.",1,male
523,RON, It's bad.,1,male
524,RON, {weakly} Okay.,1,male
525,RON," But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?",1,male
526,RON," {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!",1,male
527,RON," Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?",1,male
528,RON, Perhaps you should see the nurse.,1,male
529,RON," Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!",1,male
530,RON," {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.",1,male
531,RON," It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}",1,male
532,RON, Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.},1,male
533,RON," Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping.",1,male
534,RON, Uh. It's got horrible breath!,1,male
535,RON, What?!,1,male
536,RON," Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}",1,male
537,RON," Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.",1,male
538,RON," Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!",1,male
539,RON, Now what are we gonna do?!,1,male
540,RON, Ahh! Harry!,1,male
541,RON, Harry!,1,male
542,RON, Help!,1,male
543,RON, Help! Help me!,1,male
544,RON, Ahhh!,1,male
545,RON, Yeah.,1,male
546,RON, {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!,1,male
547,RON," {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try.",1,male
548,RON, We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.,1,male
549,RON," Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!",1,male
550,RON, This complicates things a bit!,1,male
551,RON, Hurry up!,1,male
552,RON," This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}",1,male
553,RON," It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}",1,male
554,RON," {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}",1,male
555,RON," You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!",1,male
556,RON," You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.",1,male
557,RON," {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3.",1,male
558,RON, Check.,1,male
559,RON, Ahhhh!,1,male
560,RON, All right? You?,1,male
649,NEVILLE, Trevor! {McGonagall stares down at him} Sorry. {He backs away.},1,male
650,NEVILLE," Seamus, that picture's moving!",1,male
651,NEVILLE," The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.",1,male
652,NEVILLE, Oh...,1,male
653,NEVILLE, AHH!,1,male
654,NEVILLE, {soars away} Down! Down! Ahhhh!,1,male
655,NEVILLE, Help!!!,1,male
656,NEVILLE, AHH!,1,male
657,NEVILLE, Help!,1,male
658,NEVILLE," Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! {zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.} Oh. Ah...help! {He wavers, then the cloak rips, and he falls, catching on a torch, but then slipping out and falling to the ground.} Ahh!",1,male
659,NEVILLE, Owowowow.,1,male
660,NEVILLE, Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.,1,male
661,NEVILLE," {appears behind a chair} Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?",1,male
662,NEVILLE, No! I won't let you! {stands} You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. {holds out fists.},1,male
663,DRACO," It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. {Students whisper, Harry Potter?} This is Crabbe, and Goyle {nods to thugs} and I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. {Ron snickers at his name} Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand me down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. {extends hand.}",1,male
664,DRACO, Up! {broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.},1,male
665,DRACO," {snickers} Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat ass. {Laughs.}",1,male
666,DRACO," No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. {hops on broom and soars around group, then through.} How 'bout up on the roof?? {soars off and hovers high in the sky.} What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?",1,male
667,DRACO," Is that so? {Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.} Have it your way, then! {He throws the Remembrall into the air.}",1,male
668,DRACO, Wingardium Levio-saaa.,1,male
669,DRACO, No!,1,male
670,DRACO," Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us.""",1,male
671,DRACO, The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...{a howl sounds}...werewolves!,1,male
672,DRACO, Okay. Then I get Fang!,1,male
673,DRACO, You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.,1,male
674,DRACO," Scared, Potter?! {Scoffs} {howl} Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.",1,male
675,DRACO," {A look of pure fear} AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! {runs away, with Fang} HELP!!!!!",1,male
676,DRACO," Nice one, Mate! {sees Ron looking at him and sneers.}",1,male
677,SNAPE," There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.",1,male
678,SNAPE," Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}",1,male
679,SNAPE, And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?,1,male
680,SNAPE," Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?",1,male
681,SNAPE," Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}",1,male
682,SNAPE," What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}",1,male
683,SNAPE," You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.",1,male
684,SNAPE," You know perfectly well what I mean. {Snape senses something. Harry stops breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.} We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.",1,male
685,SNAPE," Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?",1,male
686,SNAPE," You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}",1,male
700,HARRY," I can't, Hedwig.  I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon --",2,male
701,HARRY, Now you've done it.,2,male
702,HARRY, She's bored.  If I could just let her out for an hour or two --,2,male
703,HARRY, But I haven't gotten any messages. From any of my friends.  Not one. All summer.,2,male
704,HARRY," I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don't exist.",2,male
705,HARRY, What... Who are you?,2,male
706,HARRY," I see.  Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.",2,male
707,HARRY, Why don't you sit down?,2,male
708,HARRY, Shhhh!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to offend you or anything --,2,male
709,HARRY, You can't have met many decent wizards then.,2,male
710,HARRY, Are you... all right?,2,male
711,HARRY, Your... family?,2,male
712,HARRY, Not go back?  But... I have to.,2,male
713,HARRY, What terrible things?  Who's plotting them?,2,male
714,HARRY, Okay!  I understand.  You can't say --,2,male
715,HARRY, Stop!  Stop!,2,male
716,HARRY, See why I've got to go back?  I don't belong here.  I belong in your world -- at Hogwarts.  It's the only place I've got... friends.,2,male
717,HARRY," Well, I expect they've been -- hang on, how do you know my friends haven't been writing me?",2,male
718,HARRY, Give me those.  Now.,2,male
719,HARRY, Dobby... Please... No...,2,male
720,HARRY, I can't.  Hogwarts is my home.,2,male
721,HARRY," 'Dear Mr. Potter.  We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence at twelve minutes past seven this evening.  As you know, underage wizards...'",2,male
722,HARRY," Well done, Dudley.  Finally learned the days of the week, have you.",2,male
723,HARRY, It's no good turning your beak up. It's all we've got.,2,male
724,HARRY, Ron?,2,male
725,HARRY, Fred?  George?  What're you doing here?,2,male
726,HARRY, Hedwig!,2,male
727,HARRY, I think it's... brilliant!,2,male
728,HARRY, Raids?,2,male
729,HARRY, The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts...?,2,male
730,HARRY, Floo Powder?,2,male
731,HARRY, D-Dia-gon Alley!,2,male
732,HARRY," I'm fine, thanks.  I'm just --",2,male
733,HARRY, Hagrid!,2,male
734,HARRY," I was lost, I -- Hang on.  What were you doing down there?",2,male
735,HARRY, I need to remember that one.,2,male
736,HARRY, Who?,2,male
737,HARRY, Thank you.,2,male
738,HARRY, You have these.  I'll buy my own!--,2,male
739,HARRY, He was a murderer.,2,male
740,HARRY, His name is Voldemort.,2,male
741,HARRY, Sorry.  Lost control of the trolley. Why can't we get through?,2,male
742,HARRY, The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock.  We've missed it.,2,male
743,HARRY, Maybe we should go wait by the car.,2,male
744,HARRY, This is mad.  We can't drive to Hogwarts.,2,male
745,HARRY," You don't mean -- Ron, no.",2,male
746,HARRY, Something tells me we're going to regret this.,2,male
747,HARRY," No offense, Ron, but are you sure you know how to fly this.",2,male
748,HARRY," Uh, Ron.  I should tell you.  Most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.",2,male
749,HARRY, There!  Up ahead!  Look...,2,male
750,HARRY, Do you hear that?,2,male
751,HARRY, I'm trying!  Your hand's all sweaty!,2,male
752,HARRY, I think we found the train.,2,male
753,HARRY," Just out of interest, Ron.  Have you ever landed a car before?",2,male
754,HARRY, UP!  UP!,2,male
755,HARRY, MIND THAT TREE!,2,male
756,HARRY, TURN!  TURN!,2,male
757,HARRY, Be thankful it's not your neck.,2,male
758,HARRY, Reverse!  Reverse!,2,male
759,HARRY," A house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to Platform Nine and Three Quarters, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.",2,male
760,HARRY, Professor Dumbledore.  Professor McGonagall...,2,male
761,HARRY, Mr. Filch.  You dropped this...,2,male
762,HARRY, You're doomed.,2,male
763,HARRY," Hello, Colin.  Nice to meet --",2,male
764,HARRY, Look at it this way.  How much worse can things get?,2,male
765,HARRY, 'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's favorite color?',2,male
766,HARRY, 'When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday and what would his ideal gift be?',2,male
767,HARRY," Hands on?  Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing.",2,male
768,HARRY, Draco?,2,male
769,HARRY," Get out of the way, Colin! Let's take him to Hagrid.  He'll know what to do.",2,male
770,HARRY," Malfoy.  He called Hermione, well, I don't know exactly what it means...",2,male
771,HARRY, That's horrible.,2,male
772,HARRY, What?,2,male
773,HARRY," No... not you, that... voice.",2,male
774,HARRY, That... voice.  Didn't you hear it?,2,male
775,HARRY, Spooky.,2,male
776,HARRY, Did you hear it?,2,male
777,HARRY, That... voice.,2,male
778,HARRY," I heard it first in Lockhart's office and then again, just --",2,male
779,HARRY, It's moving.  I think it's going to... kill.,2,male
780,HARRY, That's Filch's cat.  Mrs. Norris.,2,male
781,HARRY," It's not true, sir!  I swear!  I never touched Mrs. Norris -- And I don't even know what a Squib is.",2,male
782,HARRY, When I said I wasn't hungry.  We were heading back to the Common Room and... found Mrs. Norris.,2,male
783,HARRY, Yes.,2,male
784,HARRY, He said he didn't.,2,male
785,HARRY," You do believe me, don't you?",2,male
786,HARRY," I can't explain it -- it was... scary. D'you think I should've told them! -- Dumbledore and the others, I mean.",2,male
787,HARRY," But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it's really been opened, that means...",2,male
788,HARRY," Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.  I mean, look at his family.  The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.",2,male
789,HARRY, How long will it take to make?,2,male
790,HARRY, A month?  But if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin... he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.,2,male
791,HARRY, No... no... not you.,2,male
792,HARRY, Dobby!,2,male
793,HARRY, It was you!  You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through!,2,male
794,HARRY, You nearly got Ron and me expelled!,2,male
795,HARRY, Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?,2,male
796,HARRY," You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!",2,male
797,HARRY, I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?,2,male
798,HARRY," Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?",2,male
799,HARRY," Repeat itself?  You mean, this has happened before?",2,male
800,HARRY," Tell me, Dobby?  When did this happen before?  Who's doing it now?",2,male
801,HARRY," No, Dobby!  Tell me!  Who is it?",2,male
802,HARRY, Nice to meet you.  I'm --,2,male
803,HARRY, I wouldn't bet on that.,2,male
804,HARRY, You wish.,2,male
805,HARRY, Rictusempra!,2,male
806,HARRY, Leave him!,2,male
807,HARRY, LEAVE HIM!,2,male
808,HARRY, I'm a what?,2,male
809,HARRY," I know.  I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.  But so what?  I bet loads of people here can do it.",2,male
810,HARRY, What's bad?  If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin --,2,male
811,HARRY, You were there!  You heard me!,2,male
812,HARRY, I spoke a different language?  But I didn't realize -- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?,2,male
813,HARRY, But I'm not.  I... can't be.,2,male
814,HARRY," Who am I, Hedwig?  What am I?",2,male
815,HARRY, Hagrid... what're you doing here?,2,male
816,HARRY, It's nothing.  I'd better get going.  I've got a lot of studying...,2,male
817,HARRY," Professor, I swear I didn’t --",2,male
818,HARRY," Well, you see, I was wondering...",2,male
819,HARRY, You're wrong!,2,male
820,HARRY," Professor, your bird... I couldn't do anything... He just caught fire.",2,male
821,HARRY," You don't think it was me, Professor?",2,male
822,HARRY," No, Professor.  Nothing.",2,male
823,HARRY, He's the only one.,2,male
824,HARRY, Maybe they're right.,2,male
825,HARRY, I didn't know I could speak Parseltongue.  What else don't I know about myself?  Maybe you can do something... even something horrible... and not know you did it.,2,male
826,HARRY, Crabbe and Goyle.,2,male
827,HARRY, Ron?,2,male
828,HARRY, We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.,2,male
829,HARRY, Lower.,2,male
830,HARRY, Less intelligent.,2,male
831,HARRY, Excellent.,2,male
832,HARRY," Hermione, are you okay?",2,male
833,HARRY, You're wrong!,2,male
834,HARRY, Harry Potter.,2,male
835,HARRY, Then you must have some idea who's behind it all?,2,male
836,HARRY," Hermione, come out.  We've got loads to tell you!",2,male
837,HARRY, Nothing.,2,male
838,HARRY, Neville asked to borrow a tubeworm in Potions yesterday.  I suppose that's something.,2,male
839,HARRY, Looks like Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.,2,male
840,HARRY, Why would I throw something at you?,2,male
841,HARRY, Who threw it at you anyway?,2,male
842,HARRY, This is a diary.  And it's old...,2,male
843,HARRY, I'll take my chances... Ahhh!  MY EYES!  MY EYES!,2,male
844,HARRY, Ginny!  I was only joking -- Brilliant.  Even your sister thinks I'm the monster now.,2,male
845,HARRY, That's odd.  He never wrote in it.,2,male
846,HARRY, Special Services to the School or something --,2,male
847,HARRY, Yes.  Why?,2,male
848,HARRY, Fifty years ago!  That means --,2,male
849,HARRY," That's a brilliant theory, Hermione.  With just one tiny little flaw.  There's nothing written in this diary.",2,male
850,HARRY," You don't think I'm dangerous, do you, Hermione?  I mean, you're not scared.  Of me.",2,male
851,HARRY, Do... you... know... anything... about... the... Chamber... of... Secrets?,2,male
852,HARRY, Can... you... tell... me?,2,male
853,HARRY, Excuse me.  Could you tell me where I am?  Hello...?,2,male
854,HARRY, Ron!  Ron!,2,male
855,HARRY, It was Hagrid.  Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.,2,male
856,HARRY," The monster had killed someone, Ron.  What would any of us done?",2,male
857,HARRY," What's that you've got, Hagrid?",2,male
858,HARRY, And they found it... Tom Riddle's diary is gone.,2,male
859,HARRY, What do you understand!,2,male
860,HARRY, The library?,2,male
861,HARRY," We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him.  But if he did set the monster loose last time -- even by accident -- he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets.  And that's a start.",2,male
862,HARRY, I think it's time to get my Dad's old Cloak out again.,2,male
863,HARRY, What's that for?,2,male
864,HARRY, Are you okay?  Hagrid?  Did you hear about Hermione?,2,male
865,HARRY, Look... we have to ask you something.  Do you know who’s opened the Chamber of Secrets?,2,male
866,HARRY, Look...,2,male
867,HARRY, C'mon.,2,male
868,HARRY, You heard Hagrid.  Follow the spiders.,2,male
869,HARRY, There's something moving over there... something big.,2,male
870,HARRY, It's been here all the time!  Look at it.  The Forest has turned it wild.,2,male
871,HARRY," C'mon, we don't want to lose the trail.",2,male
872,HARRY, Don't panic.,2,male
873,HARRY," Yes.  We're friends of Hagrid's. And you... you're... ... Aragog, aren't you?",2,male
874,HARRY," He's in trouble.  Up at school, there've been attacks.  They think it's Hagrid.  They think he's opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.",2,male
875,HARRY, But if Hagrid never... that means... you're not the monster.,2,male
876,HARRY," Shhh! But if you're not the monster, what did kill that girl fifty years ago?",2,male
877,HARRY, But have you seen it?,2,male
878,HARRY, What!,2,male
879,HARRY, Well... thank you.  We'll just go...,2,male
880,HARRY, Let's go!,2,male
881,HARRY, THE WINDOWS!  ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!,2,male
882,HARRY, Don't mention it.,2,male
883,HARRY, That way!  It's the only way out! Hurry!  They're catching up!,2,male
884,HARRY, Can you get us in the air?,2,male
885,HARRY, We know one thing.  Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.  He was innocent.,2,male
886,HARRY," Wish you were here, Hermione.  We need you.  Now more than ever...",2,male
887,HARRY," 'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk.  Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.  Spiders flee before it and only the crowing of the rooster can kill it.' Ron!  This is it!  The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk.  That's why I can hear it speak.  It's a snake.",2,male
888,HARRY," Because no one did look it in the eye.  Not directly at least... Colin saw it through his camera. Justin -- Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick!  Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost -- he couldn't die again...",2,male
889,HARRY, The water... there was water on the floor that night.  She only saw the Basilisk's reflection... The crowing of the rooster is fatal to it!  That's why Hagrid's roosters were killed!  Spiders flee before it!  It all fits!,2,male
890,HARRY, Hermione answered that too.,2,male
891,HARRY, Remember what Aragog said?  About that girl fifty years ago?  She died in a bathroom.  What if she never left.,2,male
892,HARRY," C'mon.  Let's go see Lockhart.  He may be a brainless git, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber.  We can tell him what we know...",2,male
893,HARRY," We'll find her, Ron.  Ginny's going to be fine.",2,male
894,HARRY," Professor, we've got some information for you --",2,male
895,HARRY, Are you going somewhere?,2,male
896,HARRY, You're running away?  After all that stuff you did in your books?,2,male
897,HARRY, You wrote them!,2,male
898,HARRY, You're a fraud!  You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!,2,male
899,HARRY, Expelliarmus!,2,male
900,HARRY," Looks like those Dueling Lessons came in handy after all, Professor.",2,male
901,HARRY, To ask you how you died.,2,male
902,HARRY," Who was it, Myrtle?",2,male
903,HARRY, Just like that?  How?,2,male
904,HARRY," This is it, Ron.  This is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.",2,male
905,HARRY, Open up.,2,male
906,HARRY," Oh, yes there is.  You first.",2,male
907,HARRY, All right.  Let's go.,2,male
908,HARRY," Thanks, Myrtle.",2,male
909,HARRY, Lumos!,2,male
910,HARRY," Remember.  Any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away.",2,male
911,HARRY, Maybe it's asleep.,2,male
912,HARRY, Ron?  Are you okay?,2,male
913,HARRY, Wait here.  I'll go on.  I'll go on and... find Ginny.  If I'm not back in an hour...,2,male
914,HARRY, See you in a bit.,2,male
915,HARRY, Open.,2,male
916,HARRY, Ginny!  Please don't be dead. Ginny!  Wake up!  Wake up!,2,male
917,HARRY," Tom... Tom Riddle?  What d'you mean, she won't wake?  She's not...",2,male
918,HARRY, Are you a ghost?,2,male
919,HARRY," She's cold as ice.  You've got to help me, Tom.  There's a basilisk --",2,male
920,HARRY," Give me my wand, Tom.",2,male
921,HARRY," Listen, we've got to go!  We've got to save her!",2,male
922,HARRY, But she's dying!,2,male
923,HARRY, No... she couldn't -- she wouldn't.,2,male
924,HARRY, But... Why?...,2,male
925,HARRY, And why did you want to meet me?,2,male
926,HARRY," Hagrid's my friend.  And you framed him, didn't you?",2,male
927,HARRY, I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.,2,male
928,HARRY," Well, you haven't finished it this time.  In a few hours Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.",2,male
929,HARRY, Ginny stole the diary from my room?  But why?,2,male
930,HARRY, Like what?,2,male
931,HARRY, Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.,2,male
932,HARRY, You.  You're the heir of Slytherin.  You're Voldemort?,2,male
933,HARRY, Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!,2,male
934,HARRY, He'll never be gone!  Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him!,2,male
935,HARRY, Fawkes.,2,male
936,HARRY, Don't look.  Don't look into its eyes.,2,male
937,HARRY, Ginny.  You need to get yourself out... Follow the chamber... You'll find Ron...,2,male
938,HARRY," You were brilliant, Fawkes.  I just... wasn't quick enough.",2,male
939,HARRY," Of course.  Dumbledore told me. Phoenix tears have healing powers. It's all right, Ginny.  It's over. It's just a memory...",2,male
940,HARRY, Where's Lockhart?,2,male
941,HARRY, I think... I think he's telling me he can take us out of here.,2,male
942,HARRY," It's just, you see, sir, I couldn't help noticing certain things.  Certain similarities. Between Tom Riddle and me.",2,male
943,HARRY, Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?,2,male
944,HARRY, So the Sorting Hat was right.  I should be a Slytherin.,2,male
945,HARRY, Only because I asked it to.,2,male
946,HARRY, 'Godric Gryffindor.',2,male
947,HARRY, Dobby!  This is your Master?  The family you serve is the Malfoys!,2,male
948,HARRY, Sir?  I wonder if I could have that.,2,male
949,HARRY, Mr. Malfoy!  I have something of yours.,2,male
950,HARRY," I think you do, sir.  I think you slipped it into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day in Diagon Alley.",2,male
951,HARRY, Just promise me something.,2,male
952,HARRY, Never try to save my life again.,2,male
953,HARRY, With loads of help from you.,2,male
954,HARRY," There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.",2,male
1000,RON," Hiya, Harry.",2,male
1001,RON," Rescuing you, of course.  Where's your trunk?",2,male
1002,RON, Stand back.,2,male
1003,RON," Hold on, Harry!",2,male
1004,RON," Put your foot down, Fred!",2,male
1005,RON," By the way, Harry.  Happy Birthday.",2,male
1006,RON, It's not much.,2,male
1007,RON," They were starving him, Mum! There were bars on his window!",2,male
1008,RON," Ginny.  Been talking about you all summer.  Dead annoying, really.",2,male
1009,RON, Dad works at the Ministry of Magic.  In the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office.,2,male
1010,RON," That's when wizards bewitch something to drive Muggles mad. Shrinking door keys, that kind of thing.  Dad loves Muggles.  Thinks they're fascinating.",2,male
1011,RON," Harry, sir.  Harry Potter.",2,male
1012,RON," Harry's never traveled by Floo Powder before, Mum.",2,male
1013,RON, And mind you get out at the right grate!,2,male
1014,RON, Mum fancies him.,2,male
1015,RON, We better hurry.,2,male
1016,RON, I dunno.  The gateway's sealed itself for some reason.,2,male
1017,RON," Can't hear a thing. Harry.  If we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.",2,male
1018,RON, The car!,2,male
1019,RON, Who says we're driving?,2,male
1020,RON," Look, who knows when Mum and Dad will get back.  And we've got to get to school, haven't we?  And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it's an absolute emergency.  Least that's what Fred and George always say...",2,male
1021,RON, No problem.,2,male
1022,RON, There.  See.  Now I reckon all we have to do is find the Hogwarts Express and follow it.  Simple.,2,male
1023,RON, Right.,2,male
1024,RON, Uh oh.  The Invisibility Booster must be faulty.,2,male
1025,RON, Any sign of the train?,2,male
1026,RON, Brilliant.,2,male
1027,RON, It must be around here someplace.,2,male
1028,RON, Take my hand!,2,male
1029,RON, Hold on!,2,male
1030,RON," Welcome home, Harry.",2,male
1031,RON," Well... no.  but, until a few hours ago, I'd never taken off in one either.",2,male
1032,RON, Uh oh.,2,male
1033,RON, IT'S NOT WORKING!,2,male
1034,RON, STOP!  STOP!  STOP!,2,male
1035,RON, My wand!  Look at my wand!,2,male
1036,RON, What's happening?,2,male
1037,RON, What kind of tree is this?,2,male
1038,RON, Dad's going to kill me.,2,male
1039,RON," Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.",2,male
1040,RON, We'll go and get our stuff.,2,male
1041,RON," Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you?",2,male
1042,RON, I should think you'd mind your own business.,2,male
1043,RON, Say it.  I'm doomed.,2,male
1044,RON, Imagine that.,2,male
1045,RON, Bloody bird's a menace -- Oh... no.,2,male
1046,RON, Look at these questions.  They're all about him.,2,male
1047,RON, 'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?',2,male
1048,RON, What do we do now?,2,male
1049,RON, Can you believe him?,2,male
1050,RON, He says he's done.,2,male
1051,RON, Uh-oh.  I smell trouble.,2,male
1052,RON, Those are Nimbus Two Thousand Ones.,2,male
1053,RON," You'll pay for that one, Malfoy! Eat slugs!",2,male
1054,RON, It's disgusting!,2,male
1055,RON, Hear what?,2,male
1056,RON," Harry, what are you doing? THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED",2,male
1057,RON, What's that?  Hanging underneath?,2,male
1058,RON, I... don't... like... spiders.,2,male
1059,RON, A Squib's someone who's born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any powers of their own.  It's why Filch is trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course.  It's also why he hates students so much.  He's bitter.,2,male
1060,RON, Maybe he was lying.,2,male
1061,RON, Are you mad!,2,male
1062,RON, Three glasses who?,2,male
1063,RON, D'you think it's true?  D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?,2,male
1064,RON, Let's think.  Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum.,2,male
1065,RON," Of course!  You heard him: 'You'll be next, Mudbloods'!",2,male
1066,RON, Crabbe and Goyle must know.  Maybe we could trick them into telling...,2,male
1067,RON, When do we start?,2,male
1068,RON," You mean, Harry and I drink some of this stuff and we turn into Crabbe and Goyle?",2,male
1069,RON, Wicked!  Malfoy'll tell us anything!,2,male
1070,RON, Hang on now.  I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it.,2,male
1071,RON, Rogue Bludger?,2,male
1072,RON," Of course!  Don't you see?  Lucius Malfoy must've opened it when he was at school here, and now he's told Draco how to do it.",2,male
1073,RON," Enlighten me.  Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girls' lavatory?  Don't you think we'll get caught?",2,male
1074,RON, Why?,2,male
1075,RON, Who's Moaning Myrtle?,2,male
1076,RON, What's the fun in that?,2,male
1077,RON, Come on.  Move.  Now.,2,male
1078,RON, You're a Parselmouth!  Why didn't you tell us?,2,male
1079,RON," Oh, that's what you said to it.",2,male
1080,RON, I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language.,2,male
1081,RON, Exactly.  And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great grandson or something.,2,male
1082,RON," Oh, c'mon, Harry.  Fred's just having a laugh.",2,male
1083,RON," Okay, so half the school thinks you're nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets every night.  Who cares?",2,male
1084,RON, Why would that make anyone feel better?,2,male
1085,RON, How?,2,male
1086,RON, And whose hair are you ripping out?,2,male
1087,RON, Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?,2,male
1088,RON, Now what?,2,male
1089,RON, Ugh.  Essence of Crabbe...,2,male
1090,RON, Think I'm gonna be sick...,2,male
1091,RON, Harry?,2,male
1092,RON, Bloody hell.,2,male
1093,RON, Bloody hell.,2,male
1094,RON, Bloody hell.,2,male
1095,RON, Bloody hell.,2,male
1096,RON, Hey... Where's Hermione?,2,male
1097,RON, Don't swing your arms like that. Crabbe holds them sort of stiff.,2,male
1098,RON, Yeah.  That's better.,2,male
1099,RON, What are you doing here?,2,male
1100,RON, What are you doing here?,2,male
1101,RON, Stomachache.,2,male
1102,RON, Ho!,2,male
1103,RON, That was close!,2,male
1104,RON, Look at your tail.,2,male
1105,RON," Madam Pince asked that we relay a message to you, Hermione:  She'd appreciate it if you'd leave a few books for the rest of the school.",2,male
1106,RON, Is that thing ever going away?,2,male
1107,RON," We all are, believe me.",2,male
1108,RON," 'To Miss Granger.  Wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher Gilderoy Lockhart.'  You sleep with this under your pillow?",2,male
1109,RON," I know Hermione's mental, but can you believe she falls for that smarmy nonsense of Lockhart's?",2,male
1110,RON, Yuck.,2,male
1111,RON," But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.  I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?",2,male
1112,RON, Fifty points if you can get it through her nose.,2,male
1113,RON," It's a diary, it's old... and was most recently in a toilet, Harry.",2,male
1114,RON, Are you mad?  That could be cursed.  Dad once told me about a book the Ministry confiscated that burned the eyes out of anyone who tried to read it.,2,male
1115,RON, Who doesn't?,2,male
1116,RON, Tin Marvolo Riddle?  Hang on.  I know that name... Of course!  The night I had detention... My job was to polish the silver in the trophy room.  I remember because I kept burping slugs all over Tom Riddle's trophy.  I must have wiped slime off his name for an hour.,2,male
1117,RON, What?  What's happened...?,2,male
1118,RON," We don't even know this Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.",2,male
1119,RON," That'd be a cheerful visit. Hullo, Hagrid.  Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?",2,male
1120,RON," Well, whoever it was, they were looking for something.",2,male
1121,RON," Hey, Ginny!  Going to the match?",2,male
1122,RON," I tell you, she gets weirder and weirder by the day...",2,male
1123,RON, No... don't tell me...,2,male
1124,RON," That's Hermione.  When in doubt, go to the library",2,male
1125,RON, Hermione!,2,male
1126,RON, But you heard McGonagall.  We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class --,2,male
1127,RON, That's Dad's boss!  Cornelius Fudge.  The Minister of Magic!,2,male
1128,RON," Hagrid's right.  With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.",2,male
1129,RON, What are you doing?,2,male
1130,RON, They're heading into the Dark Forest.,2,male
1131,RON, Why spiders.  Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'?,2,male
1132,RON," Harry!... Harry, it's our car!",2,male
1133,RON," I don't have a good feeling about this, Harry --",2,male
1134,RON, Harry...,2,male
1135,RON, Can we panic now?,2,male
1136,RON, Nice knowing you.,2,male
1137,RON, I CAN'T!  IT'S STUCK!,2,male
1138,RON, Thanks for that.,2,male
1139,RON, Flying gear's jammed!,2,male
1140,RON," 'Follow the spiders'!  Follow the spiders'!  If he ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill Hagrid.  I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?  What have we found out?",2,male
1141,RON," We know that, Madam Pomfrey.  It's just, well, you see, we thought, maybe, we could... be with her for a bit.  She's our... friend, you see, and... even if she can't hear us... I mean, it can't hurt, can it?",2,male
1142,RON," You don't think Lockhart could be the heir of Slytherin, do you? Right.  Forget I said it.",2,male
1143,RON, But it kills by looking people in the eye.  Why is it no one's dead?,2,male
1144,RON," And Mrs. Norris?  I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.",2,male
1145,RON, But how's the Basilisk been getting around?  A dirty great snake.  Someone would have seen...,2,male
1146,RON, Pipes...?  It's using the plumbing.,2,male
1147,RON, Moaning Myrtle!,2,male
1148,RON," She knew something, Harry.  She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets.  That's why she was taken.  I mean, she was -- is -- a pure-blood.  There can't be any other reason.",2,male
1149,RON," Harry.  D'you think there's any chance at all she's not, you know --",2,male
1150,RON, What about my sister?,2,male
1151,RON, You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!  You can't go now!,2,male
1152,RON, Is there anything you can do?,2,male
1153,RON," Say something, Harry.  Say something in Parseltongue.",2,male
1154,RON, English.,2,male
1155,RON, A bloody lot of good if it's a two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged rocks.,2,male
1156,RON, What's that?  Up ahead?,2,male
1157,RON, Bloody hell.  Whatever shed this must be twenty feet long.  Or more.,2,male
1158,RON," Heart of a lion, this one.",2,male
1159,RON," I'm okay.  This git's not, though. He got blasted by my wand.",2,male
1160,RON, What now?,2,male
1161,RON," I'll try and shift some of this rock.  So you can get back through.  And, Harry --",2,male
1162,RON, Ginny!,2,male
1163,RON, You're alive.  I can't believe it.,2,male
1164,RON, Remind you of anyone?,2,male
1165,RON, His Memory Charm backfired. Hasn't got a clue who he is.  I keep having to stop him wandering off.  He's a danger to himself.,2,male
1166,RON, No.,2,male
1167,RON, What's with the bird?,2,male
1168,RON," Welcome back, Hermione.",2,male
1182,LUCIUS MALFOY," I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin. But selling.",2,male
1183,LUCIUS MALFOY," You have heard, of course, that the Ministry of Magic is conducting more raids.  There are even rumors of a new Muggle Protection Act...",2,male
1184,LUCIUS MALFOY, I have a few... ah... items at home that might prove embarrassing if the Ministry were to call. Certain poisons and the like...,2,male
1185,LUCIUS MALFOY," Hopefully my son will amount to more than a thief, Mr. Borgin. Though if his marks don't pick up --",2,male
1186,LUCIUS MALFOY, I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizarding family beat you in every exam.,2,male
1187,LUCIUS MALFOY, Not with me.,2,male
1188,LUCIUS MALFOY," Very good.  I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow.  Come, Draco.",2,male
1189,LUCIUS MALFOY," Silence, Draco!  Ah... Mr. Potter. I don't believe we've met.",2,male
1190,LUCIUS MALFOY," Forgive me, Mr. Potter.  But your scar is legend.  As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.",2,male
1191,LUCIUS MALFOY," Yes, a pity about your parents. Curious that you yourself should escape with a mere flesh wound. Curious, too, that you speak of him in the past.  Surely, you don't think He-Who-Must-Not-Be- Named is gone forever.",2,male
1192,LUCIUS MALFOY," You must be very brave, Mr. Potter, to dare speak his name. Or foolish.",2,male
1193,LUCIUS MALFOY," You must be Miss Granger.  Draco's told me all about you... and your parents.  Muggles, aren't you?",2,male
1194,LUCIUS MALFOY," Well, well, well -- Arthur Weasley.",2,male
1195,LUCIUS MALFOY, Busy time at the Ministry.  All those raids.  I hope they're paying you overtime.,2,male
1196,LUCIUS MALFOY, Obviously not.  Dear me.  What's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it.,2,male
1197,LUCIUS MALFOY," Clearly.  The company you keep, Weasley.  And I thought your family could sink no lower.",2,male
1198,LUCIUS MALFOY," Here, girl.  Take your book.  It's the best your father can give you.",2,male
1199,LUCIUS MALFOY," Already here, Fudge?  Good, good...",2,male
1200,LUCIUS MALFOY," My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your -- do you call this a house?  I simply called at the school and was told the Headmaster was here.",2,male
1201,LUCIUS MALFOY," Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but the governors feel it's time for you to step aside.  This is an Order of Suspension.  You'll find all twelve signatures on it.  I'm afraid we feel you're losing your touch.  What with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle- borns left at Hogwarts.  And we all know what an awful loss that would be.",2,male
1202,LUCIUS MALFOY," That remains to be seen, but as all twelve governors have voted --",2,male
1203,LUCIUS MALFOY, I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that.,2,male
1204,LUCIUS MALFOY," Admirable sentiments.  We shall all miss your highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope your successor will manage to prevent any more, um, killin's.",2,male
1205,LUCIUS MALFOY," Out of my way, Potter. So!  You've returned!",2,male
1206,LUCIUS MALFOY," From the beginning, my only concern has been the welfare of this school and its students. I assume the culprit has been identified.",2,male
1207,LUCIUS MALFOY," Come, Dobby.  We're leaving.",2,male
1208,LUCIUS MALFOY, Mine?  I don't know what you're talking about.,2,male
1209,LUCIUS MALFOY, Prove it!,2,male
1210,LUCIUS MALFOY, What?  I didn't --,2,male
1211,LUCIUS MALFOY, You've lost me my servant!,2,male
1212,LUCIUS MALFOY," Mark my words, Harry Potter. You'll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days. They were meddlesome fools too.",2,male
1213,DRACO, Can I have this?,2,male
1214,DRACO, It's not my fault the teachers have favorites.  That Hermione Granger --,2,male
1215,DRACO," Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?  Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page.",2,male
1216,DRACO," Look, Potter.  You've got yourself a girlfriend!",2,male
1217,DRACO, That's right.  And that's not all that's new this year...,2,male
1218,DRACO," That's right, Weasley.  You see, unlike some, my father can afford to buy the best.",2,male
1219,DRACO," No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.",2,male
1220,DRACO," Enemies of the heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!",2,male
1221,DRACO," All right there, Scarhead?",2,male
1222,DRACO," Training for the ballet, Potter?",2,male
1223,DRACO," Scared, Potter?",2,male
1224,DRACO, Serpensortia!,2,male
1225,DRACO, Crabbe.  Goyle.  Where have you been?  Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time?,2,male
1226,DRACO," And what are you doing down here, Weasley?",2,male
1227,DRACO," Come on, boys.  Weasley thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's hair single-handed.",2,male
1228,DRACO, Listen to this...,2,male
1229,DRACO," 'Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.  ""Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,"" said Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts.  ""He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.""'",2,male
1230,DRACO," Arthur Weasley loves Muggle so much he should snap his wand in half and go join them.  You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way they behave. Embarrassment to the wizarding world.  All of them.",2,male
1231,DRACO," What's up with you, Crabbe?",2,male
1232,DRACO," Well, go to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick in the arse for me!  You know, I'm surprised The Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet.  I suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up.  He'll be sacked if it doesn’t stop soon.  Father always said Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place.",2,male
1233,DRACO, What?  Did you say that I was wrong?  You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?,2,male
1234,DRACO," Good one, Goyle.  You're absolutely right.  Saint Potter. He's another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go around with that Mudblood Granger. And people actually think he's the Heir of Slytherin.",2,male
1235,DRACO," You know I haven't, Goyle.  How many times do I have to tell you? But my father did say this much: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened.  He wouldn't tell me who opened it -- only that they were expelled -- but I know this:  the last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died.",2,male
1236,DRACO, What's the matter with you two? You're acting very... odd.,2,male
1237,DRACO, Hey!  Where are you going?,2,male
1238,HAGRID, HARRY!  What d'yer think yer doin' down 'ere?,2,male
1239,HAGRID," Yer a mess!  Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley.  Dodgy place, Harry.  Don't want no one ter see yeh down there.  People'll be thinkin' yer up ter no good.",2,male
1240,HAGRID, I was lookin' fer a Flesh Eatin' Slug Repellent.  They're ruinin' the school cabbages.,2,male
1241,HAGRID," Ignore 'im, Arthur.",2,male
1242,HAGRID," No Malfoy's worth listenin' ter. Rotten ter the core, the whole family...",2,male
1243,HAGRID, Got jus' the thing.  Set 'im down on that chair o'er there.,2,male
1244,HAGRID, Better out than in.  Who was he tryin' ter curse anyway?,2,male
1245,HAGRID, He didn'!,2,male
1246,HAGRID," Yeh see, Harry.  There are some wizards -- like Malfoy's family -- who think they're better than everyone else 'cause they're what people call pureblood.",2,male
1247,HAGRID," An' it's codswallop ter boot. Dirty blood.  There's 'ardly a wizard today that's not half-blood or less.  If we 'adn't married Muggles we'd've died out long ago. Besides, they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can't do... Don' you think on it, Hermione. Don' you think on it fer a minute.",2,male
1248,HAGRID, Gallopin' Gorgons!  Slytherin's flyin' like they got dragon fire in their brooms...,2,male
1249,HAGRID," Blimey, Harry's got 'imself a Rogue Bludger!",2,male
1250,HAGRID, Look fer yerself!  It's bin' tampered with!,2,male
1251,HAGRID, Brok'n?  He doesn't 'ave any bones at all!,2,male
1252,HAGRID," All  righ', Harry?",2,male
1253,HAGRID," Second one killed this term. Reckon it's either foxes or a Blood-Suckin' Bugbear.  Need Dumbledore's permission ter put a charm round the hen-coop.  Yeh sure yeh're all righ', Harry?  Yeh look all hot an' bothered.",2,male
1254,HAGRID," It wasn't Harry, Professor Dumbledore!",2,male
1255,HAGRID, I was talkin' ter 'im jus' before that kid was found.  It can't've bin 'im!,2,male
1256,HAGRID, I'll swear ter it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic --,2,male
1257,HAGRID, Oh.  Right.  I'll wait outside then.,2,male
1258,HAGRID," Mad an' hairy?  Wouldn' be talkin' 'bou me, now would yeh?",2,male
1259,HAGRID," Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent.  Fer the Mandrakes, yeh know. Accordin' ter Professor Sprout, they still got a bit o' growin' up ter do, but once their acne clears up, we'll be able to chop 'em up, stew 'em, an' get those people in the hospital un-Petrified.  'Til then, you three best watch yerselves, all righ'?",2,male
1260,HAGRID, Who's there?,2,male
1261,HAGRID," Nothin', nothin'.  I've been expectin'... Doesn't matter.  Sit down... I'll make tea...",2,male
1262,HAGRID," Oh, yea.  I heard, all righ'.",2,male
1263,HAGRID, C-come in.,2,male
1264,HAGRID," I never... You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir...",2,male
1265,HAGRID, Take me?  Where?  Not Azkaban prison.,2,male
1266,HAGRID, What're you doin' here!  Get outta my house!,2,male
1267,HAGRID, An' how many did yeh have ter threaten before they agreed!,2,male
1268,HAGRID, Yeh can take Dumbledore!  Take him away an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a chance!  There'll be killin's next!,2,male
1269,HAGRID," If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they'd have ter do is follow the spiders.  That'd lead 'em right!  Tha's all I'm sayin'.",2,male
1270,HAGRID, Sorry I'm late.  The owl deliverin' my release papers got all lost 'n confused.  Some ruddy bird named Errol.,2,male
1271,HAGRID," I jus' want to say... that if it wasn't fer' you, Harry... you an' Ron... and Hermione... Well, I jus' want to say... Thanks.",2,male
1359,GILDEROY LOCKHART, It can't be Harry Potter?,2,male
1360,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Nice big smile, Harry.  Together, you and I rate the front page. Ladies and gentlemen!  What an extraordinary moment this is! When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me -- which, incidentally is celebrating its twenty-seventh week atop The Daily Prophet's Bestseller List -- he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving with my entire collected works! Free of charge!",2,male
1361,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher.  Me.  Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League and five times winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award -- But I don't talk about that.  I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!",2,male
1362,GILDEROY LOCKHART," I see you've all bought a complete set of my books.  Well done.  I thought we'd start today with a little quiz.  Nothing to worry about.  Just to check how well you've read them, how much you've taken in...",2,male
1363,GILDEROY LOCKHART, You have thirty minutes.  Start -- now!,2,male
1364,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Tut, tut.  Hardly any of you remembered my favorite color is lilac.  But Miss Hermione Granger knew that my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair care potions. Good girl.",2,male
1365,GILDEROY LOCKHART, Now... be warned!  It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourself facing your own worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here...,2,male
1366,GILDEROY LOCKHART, I must ask you not to scream.  It might provoke them.,2,male
1367,GILDEROY LOCKHART, Freshly caught Cornish pixies.,2,male
1368,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan, but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters.  Let's see what you make of them now!",2,male
1369,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Come on now, round them up, round them up.  They're only pixies. Peskipiski Pesternomi!",2,male
1370,GILDEROY LOCKHART, I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.,2,male
1371,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Harry, Harry, Harry... Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than by helping me answer my fan mail?",2,male
1372,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Fame's a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that.",2,male
1373,GILDEROY LOCKHART," I was saying, six solid months at the top of the bestseller list! Broke all records!",2,male
1374,GILDEROY LOCKHART, Voice?,2,male
1375,GILDEROY LOCKHART," What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit drowsy.  Great Scott -- and no wonder -- look at the time!  We've been here nearly four hours! Dinner's nearly done!  If you hurry you might make pudding. Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun!",2,male
1376,GILDEROY LOCKHART," It was definitely a curse that killed her -- probably the Transmogrifian Torture. Encountered it myself once, in Ouagadougou.  The full story's in my autobiography...",2,male
1377,GILDEROY LOCKHART, Precisely!  So unlucky I wasn't there.  I know the very countercurse that could have spared her...,2,male
1378,GILDEROY LOCKHART," I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.  You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail...",2,male
1379,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Not to worry, Harry.  I'll fix that arm of yours straight away.",2,male
1380,GILDEROY LOCKHART, Poor boy doesn't know what he's saying.  This won't hurt a bit...,2,male
1381,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Ah.  Yes.  Well, that can sometimes happen.  The point is, the bones are no longer broken.",2,male
1382,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Gather round!  Gather round!  Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me?  Excellent.  In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club, to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions -- for full details, see my published works.",2,male
1383,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Let me introduce my assistant Professor Snape.  He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration.  Now I don't want any of you youngsters to worry.  You'll still have your Potions Master when I'm through with him, never fear!",2,male
1384,GILDEROY LOCKHART," As you can see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position.  On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.",2,male
1385,GILDEROY LOCKHART, One-two-three --,2,male
1386,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Well, there you have it.  That was a Disarming Charm.  As you see, I've lost my wand.",2,male
1387,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Ah, thank you, Miss Granger.  Yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do.  If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy...",2,male
1388,GILDEROY LOCKHART," An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape.  Let's have a volunteer pair.  Potter, Weasley, how about you?",2,male
1389,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Wands at the ready!  When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent -- only to disarm.  We don't want any accidents.  One, two --",2,male
1390,GILDEROY LOCKHART, I said disarm only!,2,male
1391,GILDEROY LOCKHART, Allow me!,2,male
1392,GILDEROY LOCKHART, So sorry.  Dozed off.  What have I missed?,2,male
1393,GILDEROY LOCKHART, My m-moment?,2,male
1394,GILDEROY LOCKHART, D-did I?  I don't recall...,2,male
1395,GILDEROY LOCKHART," V-very well.  I'll -- I'll be in my office, getting -- getting ready.",2,male
1396,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Um, well, yes.  Urgent call. Unavoidable.  Got to go...",2,male
1397,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Well, as to that -- most unfortunate.  No one regrets more than I --",2,male
1398,GILDEROY LOCKHART," I must say, when I took the job, nothing in the job description --",2,male
1399,GILDEROY LOCKHART, Books can be misleading.,2,male
1400,GILDEROY LOCKHART," My dear boy, do use your common sense.  My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves.  He'd look dreadful on the front cover.  No dress sense at all...",2,male
1401,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Harry, Harry, Harry.  There was work involved.  I had to track these people down and ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did.  No, it's not all book signings and publicity photos.  You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long, hard slog.",2,male
1402,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Yes, now that you mention it.  I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would've gone blabbing and I'd never have sold another book. I'm afraid I'll have to do the same to you both, lest you do the same.",2,male
1403,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Excellent, Harry.  Good work. Well then.  I'll just be going. There's no need for me...",2,male
1404,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Now, boys.  What good will it do?",2,male
1405,GILDEROY LOCKHART, That looks like a... snake.,2,male
1406,GILDEROY LOCKHART," The adventure ends here, boys! But don't fret.  The world will know our story.  How I was too late to save the girl.  How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. I'll even bind a limited edition in this snake skin.  Say goodbye to your memories. Obliviate!",2,male
1407,GILDEROY LOCKHART," Hello.  Odd sort of place, this, isn't it?  Do you live here?",2,male
1408,GILDEROY LOCKHART, Amazing!  This is just like magic!,2,male
1409,SNAPE, You were seen!  By no less then seven Muggles.  Do you have any idea how serious this is?  You have risked the exposure of our world.  Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that has been on these grounds for hundreds of years.,2,male
1410,SNAPE," Silence!  I assure you, were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home tonight.  As it is --",2,male
1411,SNAPE," Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...",2,male
1412,SNAPE," If I might, Headmaster...",2,male
1413,SNAPE, Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time...,2,male
1414,SNAPE," However, the circumstances are suspicious.  I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.",2,male
1415,SNAPE," Yes, Miss Granger?",2,male
1416,SNAPE, Expelliarmus!,2,male
1417,SNAPE," Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor.",2,male
1418,SNAPE," Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.  We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.  Might I suggest someone from my own house. Malfoy, perhaps.",2,male
1419,SNAPE," Don't move, Potter.  I'll get rid of it for you.",2,male
1420,SNAPE," Just the man.  A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.",2,male
1421,SNAPE, Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?,2,male
1449,DUMBLEDORE," Splendid.  Now, I suggest we return to the feast.  There's a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample.",2,male
1450,DUMBLEDORE, Argus!,2,male
1451,DUMBLEDORE, Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except you three.,2,male
1452,DUMBLEDORE," She's not dead, Argus.  She's been Petrified.",2,male
1453,DUMBLEDORE, But how she's been Petrified... I cannot say.,2,male
1454,DUMBLEDORE, Innocent until proven guilty.,2,male
1455,DUMBLEDORE," We will be able to cure her, Argus.  As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes.  When they have matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris.  In the meantime, I advise caution. To all.",2,male
1456,DUMBLEDORE, There's been another attack.,2,male
1457,DUMBLEDORE," It means our students are in great danger, Minerva.  Mr. Creevey was fortunate.  If not for this... He would surely be dead.",2,male
1458,DUMBLEDORE, Tell them the truth.  Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.  Tell them it's as we feared.  The Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.,2,male
1459,DUMBLEDORE," About time too.  He's been looking dreadful for days.  Pity you had to see him on a Burning Day.  He's really very handsome most of the time. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes.",2,male
1460,DUMBLEDORE," Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.",2,male
1461,DUMBLEDORE, Hagrid --,2,male
1462,DUMBLEDORE, Hagrid --,2,male
1463,DUMBLEDORE, HAGRID!  I do not think that Harry has attacked anyone.,2,male
1464,DUMBLEDORE," No, Harry.  But I must ask you... is there anything you'd like to tell me.  Anything at all?",2,male
1465,DUMBLEDORE," It's not wise to be wandering around this late, Tom.",2,male
1466,DUMBLEDORE," I'm afraid they are, Tom.",2,male
1467,DUMBLEDORE," Headmaster Dippet may have no choice, I'm afraid.",2,male
1468,DUMBLEDORE," Is there something you wish to tell me, Tom?",2,male
1469,DUMBLEDORE, Very well then.  Hurry along.,2,male
1470,DUMBLEDORE," Good evening, Hagrid.",2,male
1471,DUMBLEDORE," I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence.",2,male
1472,DUMBLEDORE," And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?",2,male
1473,DUMBLEDORE," Calm yourself, Hagrid! If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside.  However... you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me.  You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who... ask for it.",2,male
1474,DUMBLEDORE," Ingenious.  Simply... ingenious. Of course, Tom Riddle was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.  I taught him myself fifty years ago.  After he left, I would occasionally hear stories of his activities -- dark rumors -- but after awhile, even the rumors stopped.  When he finally resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, most people had completely forgotten the clever Head Boy he'd once been.",2,male
1475,DUMBLEDORE," Wiser wizards than you have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss Weasley.  No, I think you've endured enough.  I would suggest a bit of bed rest, however.  And perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate.  I always find that cheers me up.  Minerva, will you show Arthur and Molly up to the hospital wing?",2,male
1476,DUMBLEDORE," You two realize, of course, that in the last few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?",2,male
1477,DUMBLEDORE, And that there is sufficient evidence to expel you both?,2,male
1478,DUMBLEDORE," Therefore, it seems only fitting... That you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School. And -- let me see -- yes, I think two hundred points apiece, which, I believe, should be more than enough to secure Gryffindor the House Cup.",2,male
1479,DUMBLEDORE," Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban.  We need our gamekeeper back.",2,male
1480,DUMBLEDORE," First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.  Secondly, I sense you're troubled by something.  Am I right?",2,male
1481,DUMBLEDORE," You can speak Parseltongue, Harry, because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.  Unless I'm much mistaken, he transformed some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar.",2,male
1482,DUMBLEDORE," Not intentionally, but... yes.",2,male
1483,DUMBLEDORE," It's true, Harry.  You do possess many of the qualities Voldemort himself prizes.  Resourcefulness. Determination.  A certain disregard for the rules.  Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor.",2,male
1484,DUMBLEDORE," Exactly.  Which makes you very different from Voldemort.  It's not our abilities that show what we truly are, Harry.  It's our choices. If you want proof that you belong in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest you look more closely at this.",2,male
1485,DUMBLEDORE, Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the Hat.,2,male
1486,DUMBLEDORE," Yes.  When the governors heard that Arthur Weasley's daughter had been taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. Curiously, several of them seemed under the impression that you would curse their families if they didn't agree to suspend me in the first place, Lucius.",2,male
1487,DUMBLEDORE," Oh yes.  It was Voldemort.  Only this time, he chose to act through someone else.  By means of... this.",2,male
1488,DUMBLEDORE," Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One only hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things find their way into innocent hands.  The consequences for the one responsible could be... severe.",2,male
1489,DUMBLEDORE," Before we begin our feast, let's give a round of applause to Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has been successfully administered to all those who had been petrified.",2,male
1490,DUMBLEDORE," Also, in the wake of recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been cancelled.",2,male
1503,TOM RIDDLE, Professor Dumbledore.,2,male
1504,TOM RIDDLE," Yes, Professor.  I suppose I -- I just had to see for myself, if...",2,male
1505,TOM RIDDLE, ... the rumors were true.,2,male
1506,TOM RIDDLE," About the school as well?  They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, Professor?",2,male
1507,TOM RIDDLE, Sir?  If it all stopped.  If the person responsible was caught...,2,male
1508,TOM RIDDLE," No, sir.  Nothing.",2,male
1509,TOM RIDDLE," Evening, Hagrid.",2,male
1510,TOM RIDDLE," I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid.  I don't think you meant it to kill anyone --",2,male
1511,TOM RIDDLE, Hagrid.  The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow.  The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.,2,male
1512,TOM RIDDLE, She won't wake.,2,male
1513,TOM RIDDLE, She's still alive.  But only just.,2,male
1514,TOM RIDDLE, A memory.  Preserved in a diary for fifty years.,2,male
1515,TOM RIDDLE, It won't come until it's called.,2,male
1516,TOM RIDDLE, You won't be needing it.,2,male
1517,TOM RIDDLE," I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker... I grow stronger.",2,male
1518,TOM RIDDLE," Yes.  I'm afraid so.  But then, she's been in so much pain, poor Ginny.  She's been writing to me for months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes.  Ginny poured her soul out to me.  I grew stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets.  I grew powerful enough to start feeding Ginny a few secrets, to start pouring a bit of my soul back into her...",2,male
1519,TOM RIDDLE," Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.",2,male
1520,TOM RIDDLE, It was Ginny who set the Basilisk on the Mudbloods and the Squib's cat.  Ginny who wrote threatening messages on the walls.,2,male
1521,TOM RIDDLE," Because I told her to.  You'll find that I can be very persuasive.  Not that she knew what she was doing.  She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her and she tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom.  But then, who should find it... but you.  The very person I was most anxious to meet.",2,male
1522,TOM RIDDLE," Ginny told me all about you.  I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could.  So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.",2,male
1523,TOM RIDDLE, It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think Hagrid was innocent.,2,male
1524,TOM RIDDLE," I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school.  So I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day... I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.",2,male
1525,TOM RIDDLE," Haven't I told you, that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore?  For many months now, my new target has been... you. Imagine my disappointment when I learned Ginny had stolen the diary back from you.",2,male
1526,TOM RIDDLE, She was afraid.  Afraid you'd learn how to work the diary. Afraid I'd tell you just who it was that had been strangling all those roosters.,2,male
1527,TOM RIDDLE," Come now, Harry.  Don't look so disappointed.  Had Ginny succeeded in destroying the diary, she would have destroyed me.  And we couldn't be having this little talk.  And I have so many questions for you.",2,male
1528,TOM RIDDLE," Well, how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?  How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?",2,male
1529,TOM RIDDLE," Voldemort is my past, present and future.",2,male
1530,TOM RIDDLE, Surely you didn't think I would keep my filthy Muggle father's name?,2,male
1531,TOM RIDDLE, Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.,2,male
1532,TOM RIDDLE, This is what Dumbledore sends his defender!  A songbird and an old hat!,2,male
1533,TOM RIDDLE," Speak to me, Slytherin.",2,male
1534,TOM RIDDLE," Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter, shall we?",2,male
1535,TOM RIDDLE, Kill him!,2,male
1536,TOM RIDDLE," Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter.  The Basilisk only obeys me.",2,male
1537,TOM RIDDLE, Fool!  Think you're safe!  It can still hear you!,2,male
1538,TOM RIDDLE," Yes, Potter.  The process is nearly complete.  In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead.  And I will cease to be a memory.  Lord Voldemort will return.  Very much... alive.",2,male
1539,TOM RIDDLE," Remarkable, isn't it?  How quickly the venom of the Basilisk penetrates the body?  If you have any final words, Potter, you'd best speak them now.  I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live.",2,male
1540,TOM RIDDLE," So ends the famous Harry Potter. On his knees in the Chamber of Secrets.  Defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged.  You'll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry...",2,male
1541,TOM RIDDLE," Funny, isn't it?  The damage a silly little book can do? Especially in the hands of a silly little girl.",2,male
1542,TOM RIDDLE, What are you doing?  No.  Stop...,2,male
1543,TOM RIDDLE, No!,2,male
1544,HARRY, Lumos Maxima...,3,male

1551,HARRY, Yes.,3,male
1552,HARRY," Oh, yes.  I've been beaten loads of times.",3,male
1553,HARRY, That's a lie.,3,male
1554,HARRY, My dad wasn't a drunk.,3,male
1555,HARRY, Shut up!  Shut up!,3,male
1556,HARRY, No!  She deserved what she got! And you... you keep away from me.,3,male
1557,HARRY, Anywhere's better than here.,3,male
1558,HARRY, Aaaah!,3,male
1559,HARRY, Fell over.,3,male
1560,HARRY, I didn't do it on purpose.,3,male
1561,HARRY, I didn't.,3,male
1562,HARRY, The Leaky Cauldron.  That's in London --,3,male
1563,HARRY, Isn't this a bit... dangerous?,3,male
1564,HARRY, Who is that?  That man.,3,male
1565,HARRY, How'd he escape?,3,male
1566,HARRY, Yeah.  Him I've heard of.,3,male
1567,HARRY, This bus.  Don't the Muggles ever...,3,male
1568,HARRY, Hedwig!,3,male
1569,HARRY, No thank you.  Minister... I don't understand.  I broke the law. Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home --,3,male
1570,HARRY, 'The state of things' sir?,3,male
1571,HARRY," Sirius Black, you mean.  But... what's that got to do with me?",3,male
1572,HARRY, Egypt!  What's it like?,3,male
1573,HARRY," Good to see you too, Mrs. Weasley.",3,male
1574,HARRY," Of course, Mr. Weasley.",3,male
1575,HARRY," Has this anything to do with him, sir?",3,male
1576,HARRY, That he escaped from Azkaban. That he killed someone...,3,male
1577,HARRY, Voldemort...?,3,male
1578,HARRY, Voldemort...?,3,male
1579,HARRY," I know, sorry.  Ron hates it too.",3,male
1580,HARRY, Kill me?,3,male
1581,HARRY," Mr. Weasley, why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?",3,male
1582,HARRY, I didn't mean to blow her up.  I just... ... lost control.,3,male
1583,HARRY, Is he really asleep?,3,male
1584,HARRY, Close the door.,3,male
1585,HARRY, Yes.,3,male
1586,HARRY, Dunno... Maybe we've broken down?,3,male
1587,HARRY, Thanks.,3,male
1588,HARRY, What was that -- that thing?,3,male
1589,HARRY, What happened to me?,3,male
1590,HARRY, And did either of you?  You know... pass out?,3,male
1591,HARRY, But someone was screaming.  A woman.,3,male
1592,HARRY, Fortuna Major.,3,male
1593,HARRY, Yeah...,3,male
1594,HARRY," Listen, you stupid prat --",3,male
1595,HARRY, Excuse me?,3,male
1596,HARRY, Brilliant... Professor.,3,male
1597,HARRY, At least Hagrid didn't get sacked.,3,male
1598,HARRY," Yes, Professor, but I thought if you said I could go --",3,male
1599,HARRY, Really?,3,male
1600,HARRY," Not to mention The Shrieking Shack, which, according to Hermione, is the most severely haunted building in Britain.",3,male
1601,HARRY," Professor, can I ask you something?",3,male
1602,HARRY," I did think of Voldemort first. But then, I remembered that night on the train... and the Dementors...",3,male
1603,HARRY, Before I fainted... I heard something.  A woman.  Screaming.,3,male
1604,HARRY, I think it was my mother.  The night she was murdered.,3,male
1605,HARRY, Sirius Black's trying to kill me.,3,male
1606,HARRY," I'm glad you had a good time. Really.  And thanks for this. Rubbish or not, you're right.  It can't hurt.",3,male
1607,HARRY," Excuse me, sir, but... where's Professor Lupin?",3,male
1608,HARRY, Come on!  Faster!,3,male
1609,HARRY, Probably a right sight better than he normally does.,3,male
1610,HARRY, Brilliant.,3,male
1611,HARRY, What happened?,3,male
1612,HARRY, Really?  I meant the match.  Who won?,3,male
1613,HARRY," Why do they affect me so, Professor?  I mean, more than everyone else...",3,male
1614,HARRY," I'm scared, Professor.",3,male
1615,HARRY," I need to learn how to fight them. You could teach me, Professor. You made that Dementor on the train go away...",3,male
1616,HARRY, But you made it go away.,3,male
1617,HARRY, What's this rubbish?,3,male
1618,HARRY," 'Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present The Marauder's Map'...?",3,male
1619,HARRY, Hang on.  This is Hogwarts!  And that... No.  Is that really...,3,male
1620,HARRY," You mean, this map shows...",3,male
1621,HARRY, Everyone?,3,male
1622,HARRY, Brilliant!  Where'd you get it?,3,male
1623,HARRY, The One-Eyed...,3,male
1624,HARRY, Dissendium?,3,male
1625,HARRY, Mischief managed.,3,male
1626,HARRY, Shhh.,3,male

1633,HARRY, The first time I rode a broom.,3,male
1634,HARRY," There's another.  It's not happy exactly.  I mean, it is.  It's the happiest I've ever felt.  But it's... complicated.",3,male
1635,HARRY, Just do it!,3,male
1636,HARRY, Expecto Patronum!,3,male
1637,HARRY, I think I've had enough.  For today.,3,male
1638,HARRY, I was thinking of him.  And Mum. Seeing their faces.  They're just talking to me.  Just... talking. That was the memory I chose.  I don't even know if it's real...,3,male
1639,HARRY, But it's the best I have.,3,male
1640,HARRY, Everybody out!,3,male
1641,HARRY, Show yourself.,3,male
1642,HARRY, Ron!  Ron!,3,male
1643,HARRY, I could've killed him.,3,male
1644,HARRY, He was right there.  Close enough to touch. I could've killed him.,3,male
1645,HARRY," No, I won't.  Know why?  Because I don't care about your stupid rat! I don't care about your stupid cat!  I've got few other things on my mind right now!",3,male
1646,HARRY, I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.,3,male

1686,HARRY, I know what he is.  But we'll take him to the castle.,3,male

1688,HARRY," I don't reckon my father'd want his best friends to become killers for a worthless piece of vermin like Pettigrew.  Besides:  Dead, the truth dies with him.  Alive... you're free.",3,male

1706,HARRY, Hermione!  Will you please tell me what it is we're doing?!,3,male

1722,HARRY, And we do that... how?,3,male
1723,HARRY, Wait until Fred and George hear about that one.,3,male
1724,HARRY, And now we wait.,3,male
1725,HARRY, Hermione...,3,male
1726,HARRY, Before.  Down by the lake.  When I was with Sirius... I did see someone... that someone made the Dementors go away...,3,male
1727,HARRY, It was my Dad.,3,male
1728,HARRY, It was my Dad who conjured the Patronus.,3,male
1729,HARRY, Dead.  I know.  I'm just telling you what I saw.,3,male

1732,HARRY, Which means Pettigrew is slipping safely into the night.  While we just stand here...,3,male
1733,HARRY, What are you doing?,3,male
1734,HARRY, Thanks.  But we have to move.,3,male
1735,HARRY, Because that werewolf you just called is running right this way.,3,male
1736,HARRY, Let's go.,3,male
1737,HARRY, Don't worry.  My Dad will come... Right there... you'll see... he'll come... any minute... he'll conjure the Patronus,3,male
1738,HARRY, HE WILL!  He will come!,3,male
1739,HARRY, EXPECTO PATRONUM!,3,male
1740,HARRY," You were right, Hermione.  It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.  It was... me.  I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.  I knew I could do it this time, because... because I'd already done it.  Does that make sense?",3,male
1741,HARRY, I want to go with you.,3,male
1742,HARRY, Anything.,3,male
1743,HARRY, He's free -- Sirius.  We... we did it.,3,male
1744,HARRY," Afraid so.  Always been a bit of the nervous type, Ron has.",3,male
1745,HARRY, You've been sacked.,3,male
1746,HARRY, Resigned!  But why!,3,male
1747,HARRY, Snape.,3,male
1748,HARRY, But Dumbledore --,3,male
1749,HARRY," Well.  At first I thought it was a horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I think it was --",3,male
1750,HARRY, Yes.,3,male
1751,HARRY, Whose is that?,3,male
1752,HARRY, But... how?  Who?,3,male
1753,HARRY, That's a Hippogriff feather --,3,male
1754,HARRY, I don't think it works.  I think it's defective.,3,male
1755,HARRY," Oh, come on now.  It's just a broom.",3,male
1756,HARRY, The fastest broom in the world.,3,male
1771,STAN SHUNPIKE," Welcome to the Knight Bus. Emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard.  My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this evening. Wha' choo doin' down there?",3,male
1772,STAN SHUNPIKE, Wha' choo fall over for?,3,male
1773,STAN SHUNPIKE," Well, come on then.  Let's not wait for the grass to grow.",3,male
1774,STAN SHUNPIKE," Take 'er away, Ern.",3,male
1775,STAN SHUNPIKE, Wot you say your name was again?,3,male
1776,STAN SHUNPIKE, Whereabouts you headin'?,3,male
1777,STAN SHUNPIKE," Is it now?  Get that, Ern?  The Leaky Cauldron.  That's in London.",3,male
1778,STAN SHUNPIKE," Naah.  Haven't had an accident in -- what? -- a week is it, Ern?",3,male
1779,STAN SHUNPIKE," Who is that?  That's Sirius Black, that is.  Don' tell me you ne'er been hearin' o' Sirius Black?",3,male
1780,STAN SHUNPIKE," A murderer, he is.  Got 'imself locked up in Azkaban for it.",3,male
1781,STAN SHUNPIKE," Tha's the question, isn't it? He's the firs' that's done it. Gives me the collywobbles thinking he's out there, though, I'll tell you that.  Big supporter of You- Know-'Oo, Black was.  Reckon you heard o' him.",3,male
1782,STAN SHUNPIKE," Them!  Don' listen properly, do they?  Don' look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don'.",3,male
1783,CORNELIUS FUDGE," I should tell you, Mr. Potter, earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located just south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.  The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched and she's been properly punctured and her memory modified.  She has no recollection of the incident whatsoever.",3,male
1784,CORNELIUS FUDGE," So that's that, and no harm done. Pea soup?",3,male
1785,CORNELIUS FUDGE," Oh, come now, Harry.  The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts!  On the other hand... running away like that... given the state of things... very, very irresponsible.",3,male
1786,CORNELIUS FUDGE, We have a killer on the loose.,3,male
1787,CORNELIUS FUDGE," Hm?  Oh, nothing.  You're safe, that's what matters.  Tomorrow you'll be on your way to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty of having them brought here for you.",3,male
1788,CORNELIUS FUDGE," By the way, Harry.  Whilst you're here it would be best if you didn't... wander.",3,male
1789,CORNELIUS FUDGE, I trust business is good?,3,male
1790,CORNELIUS FUDGE, We have a killer on the loose.,3,male
1791,CORNELIUS FUDGE, Harry Potter.,3,male
1792,CORNELIUS FUDGE, Ha!  Tell that to Peter Pettigrew!,3,male
1793,CORNELIUS FUDGE, Black was vicious.  He didn't kill Pettigrew.  He destroyed him.  A finger.  That's all that was left. A finger -- there's your hearsay.,3,male
1794,CORNELIUS FUDGE, But that's not the worst of it.,3,male
1795,CORNELIUS FUDGE," Let's get this over with, shall we?",3,male
1796,CORNELIUS FUDGE, But... where is it?  I just saw the beast not moments ago -- Hagrid?,3,male
1797,CORNELIUS FUDGE," Come now, Dumbledore.  Someone's obviously released him.",3,male
1798,CORNELIUS FUDGE, We should search the grounds --,3,male
1799,RON, A cat!  Is that what they told you?  Looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me.,3,male
1800,RON, Brilliant.  It's got loads of old stuff.  Mummies.  Death masks. Tombs --,3,male
1801,RON, I also got a new wand.,3,male
1802,RON, I haven't shown anyone!,3,male
1803,RON, Brilliant!,3,male
1804,RON, I still think it was brilliant.,3,male
1805,RON, Who d'you reckon he is?,3,male
1806,RON, You know everything.  How is it she knows everything?,3,male
1807,RON, Let me get this straight.  Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?,3,male
1808,RON," Sure -- Of course, no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a raving, murderous lunatic...",3,male
1809,RON, What's going on?,3,male
1810,RON, There's something moving out there.  I think... people are coming aboard.,3,male
1811,RON, Bloody hell.  What's happening?,3,male
1812,RON," Well, you sort of went... rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.",3,male
1813,RON, No.  I felt... weird.  Like I'd never be cheerful again.  But... no.,3,male
1814,RON," Good to be home, eh, Harry?",3,male
1815,RON, Where'd you come from?,3,male
1816,RON, Well.  He's got a wonky sort of cross -- that's trials and suffering.  But this lot here could be the sun -- that's great happiness.  So... he's going to suffer but be very happy about it.,3,male
1817,RON, Ancient Runes?  Exactly how many classes are you taking this term?,3,male
1818,RON, Hang on.  Ancient Runes is the same time as Divination.  You'd have to be in two classes at once.,3,male
1819,RON, Hagrid.  Exactly what is that?,3,male
1820,RON," The little git.  He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?",3,male
1821,RON, Who?,3,male
1822,RON, When'd she get here?,3,male
1823,RON, Riddikulus!,3,male
1824,RON," And Honeyduke's is brilliant! Sugar Quills, Flaming Whizbees -- and blood-flavored lollipops for Halloween!",3,male
1825,RON, Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Dead depressing. Hang on.  I almost forgot.  I got you something wicked at Dervish and Banges.  It's a Pocket Sneakoscope.,3,male
1826,RON," If there's someone untrustworthy around, it's meant to light up and spin.  Mind you, Fred and George say it's rubbish, sold for wizard tourists, but I thought, you know, it can't hurt, given that...",3,male
1827,RON," Oh, careful of those, they'll make your...",3,male
1828,RON, Never mind.,3,male
1829,RON, What's the hold-up?  Only Neville ever forgets the password.,3,male
1830,RON, Probably stuffing her face with the apples in that still life on the second floor again.,3,male
1831,RON," Yeah, we'll call you... if we ever need someone mental.",3,male
1832,RON, Werewolves?,3,male
1833,RON, When did she come in?  Did you see her come in...,3,male
1834,RON," He's got a point, you know.",3,male
1835,RON," Looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?",3,male
1836,RON, You fell off your broom.,3,male
1837,RON," There's something else you should know, Harry.  Your Nimbus -- when it blew away? -- it sort of landed in the Whomping Willow.  And well...",3,male
1838,RON, Twice.,3,male
1839,RON, Huh?  Oh... All right...,3,male
1840,RON," Actually, it's fine from here.",3,male
1841,RON," Shut your mouth, Malfoy.",3,male
1842,RON," Bloody hell, Harry!  That was not funny!",3,male
1843,RON, Those weasels!  Never told me about any Marauder's Map!,3,male
1844,RON," Oh sure.  Along with his invisibility cloak, his pack of exploding snap cards, his --",3,male
1845,RON, It's not true!,3,male
1846,RON, Harry?,3,male
1847,RON, Aaaahhhh!,3,male
1848,RON, Is he gone?,3,male
1849,RON, I don't know how he got in!  I was a bit busy dodging his knife!,3,male
1850,RON, And this bloody cat ate my rat!,3,male
1851,RON, It is not and you bloody well know it!,3,male
1852,RON, I find it astonishing that someone who prides herself on being so logical can be in such denial.,3,male
1853,RON," Harry was there!  He'll tell you how it was.  Go on, Harry, tell her.",3,male
1854,RON," Really?  Wasn't you had to roll under the bed last night to avoid getting cut to ribbons!  A person could die being your friend, Harry!",3,male
1855,RON," Draco.  It's him the Committee should punish.  It's him they should send off to the forest, not Buckbeak.",3,male
1856,RON," She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental, but now it's out in the open for everyone to see...",3,male
1857,RON, Hermione!  No!,3,male
1858,RON, He's not worth it.,3,male
1859,RON, I'm not kissing Fang if that's what you're thinking...,3,male
1860,RON, Scabbers!  You're alive!,3,male
1861,RON," Right.  Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.",3,male
1862,RON, He bit me...,3,male
1863,RON, Now behave yourself.,3,male
1864,RON, Harry!  Run!,3,male
1865,RON, Aaaahhh!,3,male
1866,RON, Harry!,3,male
1867,RON," It's a trap, Harry.  He's the dog. He's an Animagus...",3,male
1868,RON, You're mad...,3,male
1869,RON, M-me?  It's lunatic...,3,male
1870,RON, Scabbers?  Scabbers has been in my family for --,3,male
1871,RON, So what?,3,male
1872,RON, What are you going to do to him?,3,male
1873,RON, It's Scabbers who did it!,3,male
1874,RON," My rat, sir.  Only he's not really a rat.  Well, he was a rat.  You see, he used to be my brother Percy's --",3,male
1875,RON, What in bloody hell was all that about?,3,male
1876,RON, How'd you two get over there?  I was just talking to you... over there.,3,male
1877,RON," Stand back, I said!  I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle!",3,male
1878,RON, Quiet! Thank you.  Let the man through.,3,male
1879,RON," Whose is it?  It's yours, mate.",3,male
2005,GEORGE," Not flashing that clipping about again, are you, Ron?",3,male
2006,GEORGE," Yeah, c'mon, Ron.  We'll walk you off the Astronomy Tower and see how you come out looking.",3,male
2007,GEORGE, But not clever enough.,3,male
2008,GEORGE," It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me.",3,male
2009,GEORGE, I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.,3,male
2010,GEORGE," Ah... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs.  We owe them so much.",3,male
2011,GEORGE, In his study.,3,male
2012,GEORGE, Does that a lot.,3,male
2013,GEORGE, Everyone.,3,male
2014,GEORGE, What they're doing.,3,male
2015,GEORGE, Of every day.,3,male
2016,GEORGE, The One-Eyed Witch on the third floor.,3,male
2017,FRED," No, not a soul.  Unless you count Tom.  The day maid.  The night maid.  The cook.  The bloke that came to fix the toilet.  That wizard from Belgium...",3,male
2018,FRED, George's nose looks positively massive in that photograph.,3,male
2019,FRED," Bloody hell.  'Tis, isn't it? Take after your side of the family, don't I, Mum?",3,male
2020,FRED, Peaky?  What d'you expect him to look like?  He fell fifty feet.,3,male
2021,FRED," Gave us a right good scare, mate.",3,male
2022,FRED," Clever, Harry.",3,male
2023,FRED," Besides, we've got a better way.",3,male
2024,FRED, Rubbish he says.  That there's the secret to our success.,3,male
2025,FRED," But we've decided your need's greater than ours.  George, if you will...",3,male
2026,FRED, Dumbledore.,3,male
2027,FRED, Pacing.,3,male
2028,FRED, Everyone.,3,male
2029,FRED, Where they are.,3,male
2030,FRED, Every minute.,3,male
2031,FRED," Nicked it from Filch's office, of course, first year.  Now listen. There's seven secret passageways out of the castle.  But we'd recommend...",3,male
2032,FRED," Witch, right.  But you best hurry. Filch is heading this way. Oh.  And, Harry?  When you're done, make sure to give it a tap and say, 'Mischief managed.' Otherwise, anyone can read it.",3,male
2033,NEVILLE," Hi, Harry.  Ron.  Hermione.",3,male
2034,NEVILLE, I... I think so.,3,male
2035,NEVILLE," You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?",3,male
2036,NEVILLE, Profter... Snafpt...,3,male
2037,NEVILLE, Professor Snape.,3,male
2038,NEVILLE," Yes, but I don't want the Boggart to turn into her either.",3,male
2039,NEVILLE, She carries a red handbag...,3,male
2040,NEVILLE, R-r-riddikulus!,3,male
2041,NEVILLE, But he keeps changing the password.  Twice just this morning!  I've taken to keeping a list.,3,male
2042,NEVILLE," I'm afraid so, ma'am.",3,male
2043,NEVILLE, Harry!  Wherever did you get it!,3,male
2044,NEVILLE, Yeah.  Let's see.,3,male
2045,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Don't.  Move.,3,male
2046,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Chocolate.  Eat.  It'll help.,3,male
2047,PROFESSOR LUPIN, A Dementor.  One of the guards of Azkaban.  It's gone now.,3,male
2048,PROFESSOR LUPIN, I need to have a word with the driver.  Excuse me. Eat.  It'll help.,3,male
2049,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Intriguing, yes?  Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what's inside?",3,male
2050,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Very good, Mr. Finnigan. Can anyone tell us what a Boggart looks like?",3,male
2051,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Terrifying, yes.  Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a Boggart.  Let's practice it now, shall we?  Without wands, please... Riddikulus!",3,male
2052,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Good.  So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough.  What really finishes a Boggart off is... laughter.  You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.  Neville, come up here, will you?",3,male
2053,PROFESSOR LUPIN, What would you say is the thing that frightens you most?,3,male
2054,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Didn't catch that, Neville, sorry.",3,male
2055,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Hmmm... yes.  Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother?",3,male
2056,PROFESSOR LUPIN," It won't.  But I want you to picture her clothes, only her clothes, very clearly in your mind.  Can you do that?",3,male
2057,PROFESSOR LUPIN," That's fine.  We don't need to hear it.  If you see it, we will. Now, when I open this wardrobe, Neville, here's what I want you to do...",3,male
2058,PROFESSOR LUPIN," You can do this, Neville.",3,male
2059,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Right then.  Wand at the ready. One.  Two.  Three!,3,male
2060,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Think, Neville.  Think!",3,male
2061,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Ron!  Forward!,3,male
2062,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Parvati!,3,male
2063,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Next!,3,male
2064,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Here!,3,male
2065,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Riddikulus!,3,male
2066,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Well done, everyone.  I think that's enough excitement for today.",3,male
2067,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Well, don't feel too bad.  I was roundly disappointed the first time I went.",3,male
2068,PROFESSOR LUPIN," No.  I was just trying to make you feel better.  Honeydukes' sweets are the best in the world.  Their Pepper Imps are so strong you smoke at the ears.  And Zonko's Joke Shop may be dangerous, but you can't beat their Stink Pellets.",3,male
2069,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Yes, that too...",3,male
2070,PROFESSOR LUPIN, You'd like to know why I stopped you from facing the Boggart. I should think it'd be obvious.  I assumed the Boggart would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.,3,male
2071,PROFESSOR LUPIN, But clearly... I was wrong.,3,male
2072,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Well, well.  I'm impressed.  That suggests that what you fear most of all is... fear. Very wise.",3,male
2073,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Dementors force us to relive the worst memories of our lives.  Our pain becomes their power.,3,male
2074,PROFESSOR LUPIN," The first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately.  Not by your scar.  By your eyes. They're your mother Lily's. Yes.  I knew her.  She was there for me at a time when no one else was.  We used to talk for hours. She was not only a singularly gifted witch but an uncommonly kind woman.  She had a way of seeing the beauty in whoever she met, even -- and perhaps most especially -- when that person couldn't see it in themselves...",3,male
2075,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Which perhaps explains her affection for your father.  James had, shall we say, a certain talent for trouble.  A gift, rumor has it, he passed on to you.",3,male
2076,PROFESSOR LUPIN," I could tell you stories -- and there are many about your parents, Harry -- but know this... They lived.  Every moment of every day.  You should know that. That's how they'd want to be remembered.",3,male
2077,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory, until a person is left with nothing but his worst experiences.  You're not weak, Harry.  The Dementors affect you most, because there are true horrors in your past.  Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.  You have nothing to be ashamed of.",3,male
2078,PROFESSOR LUPIN, I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.,3,male
2079,PROFESSOR LUPIN, There was only one that night...,3,male
2080,PROFESSOR LUPIN," I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.  But yes, I can teach you. Perhaps after the holiday.  For now, though, I need to rest.  I'm feeling... tired.",3,male
2081,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Beautiful...,3,male
2082,PROFESSOR LUPIN," You're sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic.  Well beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level.",3,male
2083,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Very well.  The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.  Ever hear of it?,3,male
2084,PROFESSOR LUPIN," A Patronus is a kind of positive force.  For the wizard who can conjure one, the Patronus works something like a shield.  The Dementor feeds on it instead of him.",3,male
2085,PROFESSOR LUPIN," But in order for it to work, you must think of a memory.  And not just any.  This memory needs to be a very happy one.  And powerful.",3,male
2086,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Got something?  Good.  Let it fill you up.  Lose yourself in it. Then speak the incantation: Expecto Patronum.  Without your wand...,3,male
2087,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Right then.  Shall we?,3,male
2088,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Concentrate, Harry. Concentrate...",3,male
2089,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Here!,3,male
2090,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Riddikulus!,3,male
2091,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Quickly.,3,male
2092,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Boggart, Harry.  The real thing would be much, much worse.  Just out of interest, what were you thinking of?  What memory did you choose?",3,male
2093,PROFESSOR LUPIN," That's not good enough, Harry. Not nearly.",3,male
2094,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Is it strong?,3,male
2095,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Then let's try it.,3,male
2096,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Think, Harry, think --",3,male
2097,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Riddikulus!,3,male
2098,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Well done.,3,male
2099,PROFESSOR LUPIN," So you know, Harry:  You'd have given your father a run for his money.  And, believe me, that's saying something.",3,male
2100,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Professor...?,3,male
2101,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Harry?  You all right?,3,male
2102,PROFESSOR LUPIN," I seriously doubt that, Severus. It looks to me as if it merely insults anyone who tries to read it.  I suspect it's a Zonko product.  Nevertheless, I shall pursue any hidden qualities it may possess.  As you say, it's my area of expertise.  Come, Harry.",3,male
2103,PROFESSOR LUPIN," I don't know how this map came to be in your possession, Harry, but I'm astounded that you didn't turn it in.  Did you ever stop to think that this -- in the hands of Sirius Black -- is a map to you?",3,male
2104,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Your father didn't set much store by rules either.  But he and your mother did give their lives to save yours.  Gambling their sacrifice by walking about the castle unprotected, with a killer on the loose, strikes me as a poor way to repay them.  I won't cover up for you again, Harry.",3,male
2105,PROFESSOR LUPIN," And who was that, Harry?",3,male
2106,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Very well.  I'd like you to return to your dormitory now.  Oh, and Harry?  Don't take any detours.",3,male
2107,PROFESSOR LUPIN, If you do.  I'll know.,3,male
2108,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Looking a bit ragged, aren't we, Sirius?  Finally the skin reflects the madness within.",3,male
2109,PROFESSOR LUPIN, How long have you known?,3,male
2110,PROFESSOR LUPIN," You're the brightest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione.",3,male
2111,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Wait, Sirius --",3,male
2112,PROFESSOR LUPIN, All right then.  As you wish...,3,male
2113,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Harry!  You've got to listen --,3,male
2114,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Someone else betrayed your parents, Harry.  Someone in this room right now.  Someone who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead.",3,male
2115,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Severus --,3,male
2116,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Don't be a fool, Severus!",3,male
2117,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Quiet, Sirius!",3,male
2118,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Pettigrew.  He was at school with us.  We thought he was a friend.,3,male
2119,PROFESSOR LUPIN," I thought so, too.  Until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the Map.",3,male
2120,PROFESSOR LUPIN, We would.,3,male
2121,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Harry, this man...",3,male
2122,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Hello, Harry.",3,male
2123,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Saw you coming.,3,male
2124,PROFESSOR LUPIN," I've looked worse, believe me.",3,male
2125,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Resigned, actually.",3,male
2126,PROFESSOR LUPIN, It seems that someone has let slip the nature of my condition.,3,male
2127,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Whoever.  It was bound to get out. This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving.  Parents will not want a -- someone like me -- teaching their children.",3,male
2128,PROFESSOR LUPIN," Has already risked enough on my behalf.  Besides, people like me, well... let's just say I'm used to this by now.  But before I go, tell me about your Patrons.",3,male
2129,PROFESSOR LUPIN, A stag.,3,male
2130,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Your father used to transform into one.  That's how he was able to keep me company when I became... sick.  He was a great friend James.,3,male
2131,PROFESSOR LUPIN, Mischief managed.,3,male
2132,DUMBLEDORE," Welcome!  Welcome to another year at Hogwarts!  I have a few things to say, before we become befuddled by our excellent feast.  I myself am particularly looking forward to the flaming kiwi cups, which, while somewhat treacherous for those of us with facial hair...",3,male
2133,DUMBLEDORE," Mm.  Yes.  First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts.  Good luck to you, Professor.",3,male
2134,DUMBLEDORE," As some of you may know, Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.  Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be filled by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid!",3,male
2135,DUMBLEDORE," Finally, on a more disquieting note, Hogwarts -- at the request of the Ministry of Magic -- will, until further notice, play host to the Dementors of Azkaban.",3,male
2136,DUMBLEDORE," The Dementors will be stationed at the entrances to the grounds.  While they are under strict orders not to enter the castle itself, you will on occasion see them as you go about your daily activities.  Under no circumstances are you to approach them.  It is not in the nature of a Dementor to be forgiving.",3,male
2137,DUMBLEDORE, Mr. Filch.  Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the castle for the Fat Lady.,3,male
2138,DUMBLEDORE, Dear lady.  Who did this to you?,3,male
2139,DUMBLEDORE," Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.  The rest of you... to the Great Hall.",3,male
2140,DUMBLEDORE, I didn't really expect him to linger.,3,male
2141,DUMBLEDORE," I do not believe a single professor inside this castle would have helped Sirius Black enter it, Severus.",3,male
2142,DUMBLEDORE," No... I feel quite confident the castle is safe.  And I'm more than willing to let the students return to their Houses.  But tomorrow. For now, let them sleep...",3,male
2143,DUMBLEDORE, It's astonishing what the body can endure when the mind allows itself to rest.,3,male
2144,DUMBLEDORE, Sir Cadogan.  Is it possible that you let a mysterious man enter Gryffindor Tower tonight?,3,male
2145,DUMBLEDORE, Scabbers...?,3,male
2146,DUMBLEDORE," I do, Miss Granger.  But I'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen- year-old wizards will convince few others.  A child's voice, however honest and true, is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.",3,male
2147,DUMBLEDORE," Ah... a shooting star.  If ever one was to make a wish, now would be the time.  But time, I'm afraid, is precisely our problem...",3,male
2148,DUMBLEDORE," Mysterious thing, time.  Powerful. And, when meddled with... dangerous.  Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. You know the laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen.  And you would, I feel, do well to return before this last chime.  If not... well, the consequences are really too ghastly to discuss.  Three turns should do it, I think.  If you succeed, more than one innocent life may be spared tonight.",3,male
2149,DUMBLEDORE," By the way, when in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck.",3,male
2150,DUMBLEDORE, Professor Dippet had those blackberries planted when he was Headmaster...,3,male
2151,DUMBLEDORE, How extraordinary!,3,male
2152,DUMBLEDORE," I'm quite sure the Minister isn't suggesting that you had anything to do with it, Hagrid.  How could you?  You've been with us all along.",3,male
2153,DUMBLEDORE," Search the skies if you must, Minister.  In the meantime, I wouldn't say no to a cup of tea, Hagrid.  Or... a large brandy. It seems your services will no longer be required.",3,male
2154,DUMBLEDORE," By the way, when in doubt, I always find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin... Good luck.",3,male
2155,DUMBLEDORE, Well?,3,male
2156,DUMBLEDORE, Did what?,3,male
2173,HAGRID," C'mon now, get a move on!  Got a real treat for yeh.  Great lesson comin' up.  Follow me.",3,male
2174,HAGRID," Gather 'round.  Find yerself a spot. That's it.  Now, firs' thing yeh'll want ter do is open yer books --",3,male
2175,HAGRID, Crikey.  Didn' yeh know?  All yeh've got ter do is stroke 'em.  Look --,3,male
2176,HAGRID," Righ' then.  So... so... yeh've got yer books, an' now yeh need the Magical Creatures.  Right. So... I'll... I'll go an' get 'em.",3,male
2177,HAGRID," Gee up, there! Beau'iful, isn' he?",3,male
2178,HAGRID," A Hippogriff, o' course.  Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know is they're proud.  Easily offended, Hippogriffs are.  Don't never insult one, 'cause it migh' be the las' thing yeh do.  Right then -- who wants ter come an' say hello?",3,male
2179,HAGRID," Good man, Harry!",3,male
2180,HAGRID," Tha's it.  Easy now... stop!  This here's Buckbeak, Harry.  Yeh want ter let 'im make the firs' move. It's polite, see?  Jus' take step forward, give 'im a bow, and if Buckbeak bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him.  Ready?",3,male
2181,HAGRID," Back off, Harry!  Back off!",3,male
2182,HAGRID," Well done, Harry!  Go on.  Give 'im a pat.",3,male
2183,HAGRID, Look at that!  I reckon he migh' let yeh ride 'im!,3,male
2184,HAGRID, We'll jus' set yeh behind the wing joint.  Mind yeh don' pull any feathers out.  He won' like that.,3,male
2185,HAGRID, Off yeh go!,3,male
2186,HAGRID," Good work, Harry! How'm I doin' me firs' day?",3,male
2187,HAGRID, Malfoy!  No!,3,male
2188,HAGRID, Calm yerself!  Yer fine... jus' a scratch...,3,male
2189,HAGRID, No.  I'm the teacher.  You all... you all just... Class dismissed!,3,male
2190,HAGRID, Buckbeak liked London.,3,male
2191,HAGRID," Oh.  That.  Well, I got up an' said my bit -- You know, how Buckbeak was a good Hippogriff an' as long as yeh treated 'im with respect, he'd treat you the same. Then Lucius Malfoy got up an' said his bit -- you know, how Buckbeak was a deadly dangerous beast that no teacher in their righ' mind would expose their students to...",3,male
2192,HAGRID, Buckbeak's not going back to the forest...,3,male
2193,HAGRID," He asked fer the worse, yeh see, Lucius Malfoy did.  An' the Committee granted it.  Buckbeak's bin sentenced ter death.",3,male
2194,HAGRID, Look at 'em.  Loves the smell o' the trees when the wind blows...,3,male
2195,HAGRID," They'd know I did it.  And tha' would only get Dumbledore in trouble.  Gonna come down, yeh know.  Says he wants ter be with me when it... when it happens. Great man, Dumbledore.",3,male
2196,HAGRID," Yeh will not!  Think I wan' yeh seein' a thing like this!  No. Yeh'll drink yer tea an' be off. But before yeh do -- I wan' ter see you an' Ron shake hands, Harry.",3,male
2197,HAGRID, Thin' I haven' seen 'ow it's bin betw'n you two?  Go on now...,3,male
2198,HAGRID," Good.  Now then.  Ron, I wan' ter see you give Hermione a hug.",3,male
2199,HAGRID, Go on!  You two've been at it all year.  An' I'm sick o' it.,3,male
2200,HAGRID," Crikey, tha's jus' abou' the most pathetic hug I e'er seen.  But yeh did it, an' tha's wha' matters. There's jus' one other thing...",3,male
2201,HAGRID," Yeh should keep a closer eye on yer pets, Ron.",3,male
2202,HAGRID, Crikey.  Here we go agin...,3,male
2203,HAGRID," Yeh got to go!  It's almost dark. Anyone sees yeh outside the castle it'll be trouble!  Big trouble! 'Specially you, Harry --",3,male
2204,HAGRID, Beaky...,3,male
2205,HAGRID," Professor, I swear!  I didn't!",3,male
2206,HAGRID, Just a broom.,3,male
2207,DRACO, And exactly how do we do that?,3,male
2208,DRACO," God, this place is going to the dogs.  Wait until my father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.",3,male
2209,DRACO," Potter, there's a Dementor behind you.",3,male
2210,DRACO," Give me a go at that thing.  If Potter can do it, it must be easy.  You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute --",3,male
2211,DRACO, It's killed me!  It's killed me!,3,male
2212,DRACO," It comes and goes.  Still... I consider myself lucky.  According to Madam Pomfrey, another minute or two... and I could've lost the arm.",3,male
2213,DRACO, It's this class that's ridiculous.,3,male
2214,DRACO," Well, well.  Look who's here.  You two shopping for your dream home? Seems a bit grand for you, Weasel- Bee.  Don't your family all sleep in one room?",3,male
2215,DRACO," Now that's not very friendly. Boys, I think we're going to have to teach Weasel-Bee to respect his superiors.",3,male
2216,DRACO," How dare you speak to me, you filthy, little mud --",3,male
2217,DRACO, Who did that!,3,male
2218,DRACO," Well, don't just stand there!",3,male
2219,DRACO," Wait a minute, there's something out here -- Aaaaaaahhhh!!!",3,male
2220,DRACO," Did you see the big, fat blubbering oaf?!  Oh, this is going to be rich.  Did I tell you, Father said I can keep the head -- Ah.  Come to see the show?",3,male
2235,SNAPE," I've done the dungeons, Headmaster.  No sign of Black. Nor anywhere else in the castle.",3,male
2236,SNAPE," Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts castle on one's own, completely undetected...",3,male
2237,SNAPE," You may recall, prior to the start of term, I did express my concerns when you appointed Professor --",3,male
2238,SNAPE, Turn to page 394.,3,male
2239,SNAPE," That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?  Suffice it to say, your Professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time.  Page 394.",3,male
2240,SNAPE, Quiet!,3,male
2241,SNAPE, Now.  Which of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf?,3,male
2242,SNAPE, No one?  How... disappointing.,3,male
2243,SNAPE," Quiet, Malfoy!  Though one must admit to feeling your pain.  That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger.  Tell me.  Are you incapable of restraining yourself?  Or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?",3,male
2244,SNAPE," Five points from Gryffindor! As a antidote to your ignorance, I prescribe two rolls of parchment on the werewolf by Monday morning, with particular emphasis placed on recognizing it. Passing notes, Potter?",3,male
2245,SNAPE," Not exactly Picasso, are you?  I hope you demonstrate more talent on the Quidditch pitch this weekend then you do as an artist.",3,male
2246,SNAPE, Potter.  What're you doing wandering the corridors at night?,3,male
2247,SNAPE," How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.  He, too, was exceedingly arrogant. Strutting about the castle --",3,male
2248,SNAPE, Turn out your pockets.,3,male
2249,SNAPE, Turn out your pockets!,3,male
2250,SNAPE, And this.  What might it be?,3,male
2251,SNAPE, Really... Reveal your secret!,3,male
2252,SNAPE, Read it.,3,male
2253,SNAPE, Go on.,3,male
2254,SNAPE, Why you insolent little --,3,male
2255,SNAPE," Well, well.  Lupin.  Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?",3,male
2256,SNAPE," That remains to be seen.  I've just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin.  This is supposed to be your area of expertise.",3,male
2257,SNAPE," Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.",3,male
2258,SNAPE, Expelliarmus!,3,male
2259,SNAPE," Ah, vengeance is sweet.  How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.",3,male
2260,SNAPE, I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle. And here's the proof.,3,male
2261,SNAPE, Give me a reason.  I beg you.,3,male
2262,SNAPE, Listen to you two.  Quarreling like an old married couple.  The creature and the criminal.,3,male
2263,SNAPE," Witty as ever I see.  Tell me, will you be so irreverent when I turn you over to the Dementors? Do I detect a flicker of fear? One can only imagine what it must be like to endure the Dementor's Kiss.  It's said to be unbearable to witness.  But I'll do my best.",3,male
2264,SNAPE, After you.,3,male
2265,SNAPE, Out of the way!,3,male
2266,SIRIUS BLACK, No.  Only one will die tonight.,3,male
2267,SIRIUS BLACK," Going to kill me, Harry?",3,male
2268,SIRIUS BLACK," You'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus?",3,male
2269,SIRIUS BLACK," Yes, you glow like the sun.  And you howl at the moon.  Enough talk!  He dies.  Now.  If you won't do it with me, Remus, I'll do it alone.",3,male
2270,SIRIUS BLACK," I did my waiting!  Twelve years of it!  In Azkaban!  Trust me, you wouldn't have lasted a week!",3,male
2271,SIRIUS BLACK, It's a lie!  I never would've betrayed James and Lily!,3,male
2272,SIRIUS BLACK, No!  I wasn't there!  And I'll regret it the rest of my life!,3,male
2273,SIRIUS BLACK, He's as good as dead.,3,male
2274,SIRIUS BLACK, Oh yes there is...,3,male
2275,SIRIUS BLACK," Come out, come out, Peter Come out, come out and play...",3,male
2276,SIRIUS BLACK, Brilliant!  And -- as usual -- dead wrong.  Now give us our wands back.  Remus and I have a bit of unfinished business to tend to.,3,male
2277,SIRIUS BLACK, He can't help it.  It's habit by now.,3,male
2278,SIRIUS BLACK, The Map never lies.  Pettigrew's alive.  And he's right there.,3,male
2279,SIRIUS BLACK," Not you, you idiot.  Your rat.",3,male
2280,SIRIUS BLACK," Twelve years.  A curiously long life for a common garden rat. He's missing a toe, isn't he?",3,male
2281,SIRIUS BLACK, Finger.  Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead.  Then he transformed into a rat.,3,male
2282,SIRIUS BLACK, Together.,3,male
2283,SIRIUS BLACK, Shut up!,3,male
2284,SIRIUS BLACK," Died!  Died rather than betray my friends!  And you should have realized, Peter, if Voldemort didn't kill you...",3,male
2285,SIRIUS BLACK," Beautiful, isn't it?  I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors.  It'll be nice to do it again.  Freely. That was a noble thing you did back there.  He doesn't deserve it.",3,male
2286,SIRIUS BLACK," I don't know if you know, Harry, but when you were born, James and Lily made me your guardian...",3,male
2287,SIRIUS BLACK," And, well, I'll understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle, but, so you know, you could --",3,male
2288,SIRIUS BLACK, Soon as my name's cleared...,3,male
2289,SIRIUS BLACK," Remus, old friend... did you take your potion tonight?",3,male
2290,SIRIUS BLACK, Run.  All of you.  Now.,3,male
2291,SIRIUS BLACK," You know the man you truly are, Remus.  This flesh is only flesh.",3,male
2292,SIRIUS BLACK, You might try --,3,male
2293,SIRIUS BLACK, That'll do.,3,male
2294,SIRIUS BLACK," You truly are your father's son, Harry!",3,male
2295,SIRIUS BLACK, I'll be forever grateful for this. To both of you.,3,male
2296,SIRIUS BLACK," One day perhaps.  For some time... life will be too... unpredictable. Besides, you're meant to be here.",3,male
2297,SIRIUS BLACK," But promise me something, Harry.",3,male
2298,SIRIUS BLACK, Trust yourself.  No matter the challenges you face -- and I fear they will be many -- you'll be surprised how many times you can find the answers... ...here.,3,male
2299,SIRIUS BLACK, A shooting star.  Make a wish.,3,male
2300,VOLDEMORT," NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say.",4,male
2301,VOLDEMORT," Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign.",4,male
2302,VOLDEMORT, Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door.,4,male
2303,VOLDEMORT, Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.,4,male
2304,VOLDEMORT," Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can give our guest a proper greeting! ",4,male
2305,VOLDEMORT, Kill the spare.,4,male
2306,VOLDEMORT," Do it, now!",4,male
2307,VOLDEMORT, My wand Wormtail.,4,male
2308,VOLDEMORT, Hold out your arm.,4,male
2309,VOLDEMORT, The other arm Wormtail.,4,male
2310,VOLDEMORT," Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me.",4,male
2311,VOLDEMORT," Not even you, Lucius.",4,male
2312,VOLDEMORT," There were signs my friend, and more than whispers.",4,male
2313,VOLDEMORT," Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful these past few months Wormtail.",4,male
2314,VOLDEMORT," (To Cedric's corpse) Oh, such a handsome boy.",4,male
2315,VOLDEMORT," Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic, something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I can touch you now! ",4,male
2316,VOLDEMORT," Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I said bow!",4,male
2317,VOLDEMORT, That's better. And now...,4,male
2318,VOLDEMORT," Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord obliged. Get up.",4,male
2319,VOLDEMORT," Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes.",4,male
2320,VOLDEMORT, Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's mine!,4,male
2321,VOLDEMORT, No!,4,male
2385,HARRY, Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here?,4,male
2386,HARRY, Last night.,4,male

2425,HARRY, No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.,4,male
2426,HARRY," He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right? ",4,male
2427,HARRY, What are you saying?,4,male
2428,HARRY, Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?,4,male
2429,HARRY, I'm not ready for this Sirius.,4,male

2442,HARRY, Thanks.,4,male
2443,HARRY, Excuse me..,4,male

2449,HARRY, I know so.,4,male
2450,HARRY, Yeah. Stay away from me.,4,male
2451,HARRY," I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic.",4,male
2452,HARRY, Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd...,4,male

2461,HARRY, Caught on have you. Took you long enough. ,4,male
2462,HARRY, Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.,4,male
2463,HARRY, Hagrid warned me about the dragons. ,4,male
2464,HARRY, Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.,4,male
2465,HARRY, Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?,4,male
2466,HARRY, (To the Weasly twins) Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?,4,male
2467,HARRY, Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...,4,male
2468,HARRY, I think I'd take the dragon right now. ,4,male
2469,HARRY, But then again he can take himself. ,4,male
2470,HARRY, Agreed.,4,male
2471,HARRY, Cho!,4,male
2472,HARRY, Ok thanks. Cho?,4,male
2473,HARRY, Um. (Mumbling) I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me? ,4,male
2474,HARRY, Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me. ,4,male
2475,HARRY, Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good. ,4,male
2476,HARRY, What happened to you?,4,male
2477,HARRY, What did she say?,4,male
2478,HARRY, Don't be silly.,4,male
2479,HARRY, What did you do then?,4,male
2480,HARRY, Hey!,4,male
2481,HARRY, My dress robes.,4,male
2482,HARRY, Well I expect yours are more traditional. ,4,male
2483,HARRY, Leave it alone.,4,male
2484,HARRY, Who?,4,male
2485,HARRY, Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.,4,male
2486,HARRY, Ready professor?,4,male
2487,HARRY, No.,4,male
2488,HARRY, Yeah she does.,4,male
2489,HARRY, What?,4,male
2490,HARRY, Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.,4,male
2491,HARRY, What's that supposed to mean?,4,male
2492,HARRY, Cedric.,4,male
2493,HARRY, Spectacular.,4,male
2494,HARRY, Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.,4,male
2495,HARRY, I must be out of my mind.,4,male
2496,HARRY, Myrtle!,4,male
2497,HARRY," Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?",4,male
2498,HARRY," Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?",4,male
2499,HARRY, Come seek us where our voices sound. ,4,male
2500,HARRY, An hour long you'll have to look.,4,male
2501,HARRY, Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?,4,male
2502,HARRY," Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great.",4,male
2503,HARRY, You're sure about this Neville.,4,male
2504,HARRY, For an hour.,4,male
2505,HARRY, Most likely?,4,male
2506,HARRY, You're telling me this now? You must be joking.,4,male
2507,HARRY, Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway? ,4,male
2508,HARRY, Do I?,4,male
2509,HARRY, But she's my friend too!,4,male
2510,HARRY, Hermione,4,male
2511,HARRY, I finished last Hermione.,4,male
2512,HARRY, Mr Crouch?,4,male
2513,HARRY, I can come back later Professor.,4,male
2514,HARRY, Agh!,4,male
2515,HARRY, Professor?,4,male
2516,HARRY," Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?",4,male
2517,HARRY," It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son.",4,male
2518,HARRY," Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?",4,male
2519,HARRY, Yes sir.,4,male
2520,HARRY, Bubble juice sir?,4,male
2521,HARRY, I haven't stolen anything.,4,male
2522,HARRY, Fleur? Fleur!,4,male
2523,HARRY, No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.,4,male
2524,HARRY, He's bewitched!,4,male
2525,HARRY, For a moment so did I.,4,male
2526,HARRY, Some game.,4,male
2527,HARRY," Together, on three. One, two, three! ",4,male
2528,HARRY," Yeah, you?",4,male
2529,HARRY, I've been here before.,4,male
2530,HARRY," I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now! ",4,male
2531,HARRY, Get back to the cup!,4,male
2532,HARRY, Cedric!,4,male
2533,HARRY, Don't touch him.,4,male
2534,HARRY, Have it your way.,4,male
2535,HARRY," He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there. ",4,male
2536,HARRY, Not so much now.,4,male
2537,HARRY, The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it.,4,male
2538,HARRY, Who?,4,male
2539,HARRY, I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares. ,4,male
2540,HARRY, Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.,4,male
2541,HARRY, It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But...,4,male
2542,HARRY," That's Moody, but then who's...?",4,male
2543,HARRY," Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.",4,male
2544,HARRY, No I don't think so.,4,male
2545,HARRY, Yes.,4,male
2546,HARRY, Yeah. Every week.,4,male
2547,RON, Bloody hell.,4,male
2548,RON, Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going? ,4,male
2549,RON," Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?",4,male
2550,RON," There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist. ",4,male
2551,RON, Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.,4,male
2552,RON, Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand. ,4,male
2553,RON," On second thought, just the drewbals. ",4,male
2554,RON," Just the drewbals, thanks.",4,male
2555,RON," Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.",4,male
2556,RON," Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!",4,male
2557,RON," Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.",4,male
2558,RON, He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.,4,male
2559,RON, Yes...,4,male
2560,RON," Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse.",4,male
2561,RON," Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know.",4,male
2562,RON," Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen.",4,male
2563,RON, How did you do it?,4,male
2564,RON, Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though. ,4,male
2565,RON, You know bloody well what.,4,male
2566,RON," Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend.",4,male
2567,RON, Piss off.,4,male
2568,RON, Who you talking to?,4,male
2569,RON, I heard voices.,4,male
2570,RON, You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.,4,male
2571,RON, You think so?,4,male
2572,RON, Anything else?,4,male
2573,RON, Fine.,4,male
2574,RON, I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.,4,male
2575,RON, Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.,4,male
2576,RON, At least I warned you about the dragons. ,4,male
2577,RON," Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out.",4,male
2578,RON, Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.,4,male
2579,RON, Thank you Nigel.,4,male
2580,RON, Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.,4,male
2581,RON, I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??,4,male
2582,RON, Ginny these must be for you.,4,male
2583,RON, What are you on about?,4,male
2584,RON, Dress robes? for what?,4,male
2585,RON, (Whispering to Seamus) Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan.,4,male
2586,RON, Where?,4,male
2587,RON," Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?",4,male
2588,RON, This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates. ,4,male
2589,RON," Well, us and Neville!",4,male
2590,RON, Now I'm really depressed.,4,male
2591,RON," Well Hermione, you're a girl.",4,male
2592,RON, Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.,4,male
2593,RON, Bloody hell.,4,male
2594,RON," Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?",4,male
2595,RON," There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out.",4,male
2596,RON, What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.,4,male
2597,RON, Bloody hell.,4,male
2598,RON, What are those??,4,male
2599,RON," Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar.",4,male
2600,RON, Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.,4,male
2601,RON, I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.,4,male
2602,RON," Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out.",4,male
2603,RON," Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?",4,male
2604,RON, Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud.,4,male
2605,RON, No. Absolutely not.,4,male
2606,RON," No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor. ",4,male
2607,RON, He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.,4,male
2608,RON," Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.",4,male
2609,RON, No.,4,male
2610,RON, (To Hermione) He's using you.,4,male
2611,RON, Doubt it. He's way too old.,4,male
2612,RON, Yeah that is what I think.,4,male
2613,RON, Go on.,4,male
2614,RON, Well that's completely off the point. Harry...,4,male
2615,RON, They get scary when they get older. ,4,male
2616,RON, Well... yeah... a bit,4,male
2617,RON, Merci.,4,male
2618,RON, Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.,4,male
2619,RON, We're still misfits.,4,male
2620,RON, Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?,4,male
2621,RON, Well I won't. You know I won't!,4,male
2622,ARTHUR," Haven't the foggiest, keep up!",4,male
2623,ARTHUR," Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory everyone, he works with me at the ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?",4,male
2624,ARTHUR," That's it sir, just over there.",4,male
2625,ARTHUR, Harry!,4,male
2626,ARTHUR, Let go kids!,4,male
2627,ARTHUR, Let! Go!,4,male
2628,ARTHUR, I bet that cleared your sinuses eh? ,4,male
2629,ARTHUR," Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!",4,male
2630,ARTHUR, Home sweet home.,4,male
2631,ARTHUR," Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen we're all hungry. ",4,male
2632,ARTHUR, Feet off the table.,4,male
2633,ARTHUR," Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for.",4,male
2634,ARTHUR, Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now.,4,male
2635,ARTHUR," Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred, George... Ginny is your responsibility.",4,male
2636,ARTHUR, Stop! That's my son.,4,male
2637,ARTHUR," Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright? ",4,male
2638,ARTHUR, You can't possibly..,4,male
2639,ARTHUR," Barty, they're just kids.",4,male
2640,ARTHUR," Harry, who?",4,male
2641,CEDRIC, Yes sir.,4,male
2642,CEDRIC, Alright.,4,male
2643,CEDRIC," Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...?",4,male
2644,CEDRIC," Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear them. ",4,male
2645,CEDRIC, Hey Potter.,4,male
2646,CEDRIC, How are you?,4,male
2647,CEDRIC, Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off about those dragons.,4,male
2648,CEDRIC, Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?,4,male
2649,CEDRIC, It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things over in the hot water.,4,male
2650,CEDRIC, Get down!,4,male
2651,CEDRIC, Get off me!,4,male
2652,CEDRIC, Harry! Harry!,4,male
2653,CEDRIC, You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me.,4,male
2654,CEDRIC, Some game huh?,4,male
2655,CEDRIC," Go. Take it, you saved me!",4,male
2656,CEDRIC, You ok?,4,male
2657,CEDRIC, Where are we?,4,male
2658,CEDRIC, It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey. ,4,male
2659,CEDRIC, What are you talking about?,4,male
2660,CEDRIC, What is it?,4,male
2661,CEDRIC, Who are you? What do you want?,4,male
2662,CEDRIC, (voice) Harry take my body back will you? Take my body back to my father. ,4,male
2663,FRED, That isn't just any old manky boot mate. ,4,male
2664,FRED, It's the Irish!,4,male
2665,FRED, Sounds like the irish have got their pride on.,4,male
2666,FRED, Wicked.,4,male
2667,FRED, Cooked it up just this morning.,4,male
2668,FRED, Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.,4,male
2669,FRED, So?,4,male
2670,FRED, Ready George?,4,male
2671,FRED, Lose a leg.,4,male
2672,FRED, Pack it in altogether.,4,male
2673,FRED," Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in.",4,male
2674,FRED, (Whispering to George) Try saying that five times faster.,4,male
2675,FRED, All that moral fibre eh?,4,male
2676,GEORGE, It's a portkey.,4,male
2677,GEORGE, Come on!,4,male
2678,GEORGE, Here come the Bulgarians!,4,male
2679,GEORGE, Yes!,4,male
2680,GEORGE, That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!,4,male
2681,GEORGE," Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it.",4,male
2682,GEORGE, That's why it's so brilliant.,4,male
2683,GEORGE, Ready Fred?,4,male
2684,GEORGE, You said..,4,male
2685,GEORGE, We knew you wouldn't die Harry.,4,male
2686,GEORGE, Or an arm.,4,male
2687,GEORGE, Well done 'moral fibre'.,4,male
2688,BARTY, Which of you conjured this?,4,male
2689,BARTY, Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!,4,male
2690,BARTY, Follow me.,4,male
2691,BARTY," All of you, this way.",4,male
2692,BARTY, After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final.,4,male
2693,BARTY," The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards champion. ",4,male
2694,BARTY," Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will...",4,male
2695,BARTY, The welsh green. Mr Krum...,4,male
2696,BARTY, The chinese fireball. Oooooh.,4,male
2697,BARTY, The swedish short-snout. Which leaves... ,4,male
2698,BARTY, What's that boy?,4,male
2699,BARTY," The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to proceed to the next task. Any questions?",4,male
2700,BARTY, Get him another towel.,4,male
2701,BARTY," Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today Potter.",4,male
2702,BARTY," Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential. Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater. Do you accept these terms?",4,male
2703,BARTY, What do you wish to present?,4,male
2704,BARTY, Mr Rosier is dead.,4,male
2705,BARTY, If that is all the witness has to offer... ,4,male
2706,BARTY, Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries.,4,male
2707,BARTY, Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be returned to Azkaban.,4,male
2708,BARTY, Silence!,4,male
2709,BARTY, Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this session is now concluded.,4,male
2710,BARTY, What's that?,4,male
2711,BARTY, Yes?,4,male
2712,BARTY, The name! Give me the wretched name! ,4,male
2713,BARTY, You are no son of mine.,4,male
2714,HAGRID, Clear the runway.,4,male
2715,HAGRID, No... No.,4,male
2716,HAGRID, Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you?,4,male
2717,HAGRID, You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important.,4,male
2718,HAGRID, As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now and again. ,4,male
2719,HAGRID," Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on.",4,male
2720,HAGRID, Bonsoir Olympe.,4,male
2721,HAGRID, Couldn't forget you Olympe.,4,male
2722,HAGRID, You'll be glad you came. Trust me. ,4,male
2723,HAGRID, Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures.,4,male
2724,HAGRID," Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know.",4,male
2725,HAGRID, Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania. Didn't Ron tell you that?,4,male
2726,HAGRID," I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though. You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one hand by the age of six and put him up in the dresser.",4,male
2727,HAGRID," And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own way as it were. But enough of me, what about you!",4,male
2728,HAGRID," So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we all are, four years later.",4,male
2729,HAGRID," Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be! The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray!",4,male
2730,DUMBLEDORE," Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen... ",4,male
2731,DUMBLEDORE," So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam Maxime. ",4,male
2732,DUMBLEDORE," And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff. ",4,male
2733,DUMBLEDORE, Igor.,4,male
2734,DUMBLEDORE," Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them.",4,male
2735,DUMBLEDORE," Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks. ",4,male
2736,DUMBLEDORE, For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch.,4,male
2737,DUMBLEDORE," My dear old friend, thanks for coming. ",4,male
2738,DUMBLEDORE, Silence!,4,male
2739,DUMBLEDORE," The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun. ",4,male
2740,DUMBLEDORE," Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection!",4,male
2741,DUMBLEDORE, The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!,4,male
2742,DUMBLEDORE, The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour,4,male
2743,DUMBLEDORE, The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory. ,4,male
2744,DUMBLEDORE," Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!",4,male
2745,DUMBLEDORE, Harry Potter. Harry Potter?,4,male
2746,DUMBLEDORE, Harry Potter!,4,male
2747,DUMBLEDORE, Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire?,4,male
2748,DUMBLEDORE, Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you?,4,male
2749,DUMBLEDORE, You're absolutely sure?,4,male
2750,DUMBLEDORE, That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty.,4,male
2751,DUMBLEDORE, What do you suggest Minerva?,4,male
2752,DUMBLEDORE, You heard Barty the rules are clear. ,4,male
2753,DUMBLEDORE," I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you?",4,male
2754,DUMBLEDORE," Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are. ",4,male
2755,DUMBLEDORE," Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can fully appreciate. ",4,male
2756,DUMBLEDORE, What are you doing here Miss Granger? ,4,male
2757,DUMBLEDORE, Barty. The bag.,4,male
2758,DUMBLEDORE, Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the cannon...,4,male
2759,DUMBLEDORE, (VOICEOVER THE LOUDSPEAKER) Three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth and final contestant.,4,male
2760,DUMBLEDORE," (Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the second task. Last night something was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough. Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that they'll be on their own.",4,male
2761,DUMBLEDORE, (Continued) You may begin at the start of the cannon.,4,male
2762,DUMBLEDORE, (Over the loudspeaker) The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task.,4,male
2763,DUMBLEDORE, Harry!,4,male
2764,DUMBLEDORE, I want all the judges over here now. ,4,male
2765,DUMBLEDORE, Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!,4,male
2766,DUMBLEDORE," For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second place! For outstanding moral fibre.",4,male
2767,DUMBLEDORE," A man has died here. And he won't be the last, you must take action.",4,male
2768,DUMBLEDORE, Then for once show them some.,4,male
2769,DUMBLEDORE," But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think.",4,male
2770,DUMBLEDORE," Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp.",4,male
2771,DUMBLEDORE, The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I am. ,4,male
2772,DUMBLEDORE," Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning. ",4,male
2773,DUMBLEDORE," He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask?",4,male
2774,DUMBLEDORE, Have there been other dreams like this? ,4,male
2775,DUMBLEDORE," I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I think it's best that you simply...",4,male
2776,DUMBLEDORE, Cast them away.,4,male
2777,DUMBLEDORE, Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory...,4,male
2778,DUMBLEDORE, (continued) and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...,4,male
2779,DUMBLEDORE," (continued) The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. Contestants, gather round. ",4,male
2780,DUMBLEDORE," (To the contestants) In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way.",4,male
2781,DUMBLEDORE, On the count of three... ONE...,4,male
2782,DUMBLEDORE, Harry! Harry!,4,male
2783,DUMBLEDORE, Tell me what happened!,4,male
2784,DUMBLEDORE," It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are.",4,male
2785,DUMBLEDORE, Severus...,4,male
2786,DUMBLEDORE, Do you know who I am?,4,male
2787,DUMBLEDORE, Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?,4,male
2788,DUMBLEDORE, Is he in this room? Is he in this room? ,4,male
2789,DUMBLEDORE, Harry get away from there!,4,male
2790,DUMBLEDORE, Are you alright Alastor?,4,male
2791,DUMBLEDORE, Now we know who's been stealing it from your store Severus.,4,male
2792,DUMBLEDORE, We'll get you up in a minute.,4,male
2793,DUMBLEDORE, Barty Crouch Junior.,4,male
2794,DUMBLEDORE, Your arm Harry.,4,male
2795,DUMBLEDORE," Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner. ",4,male
2796,DUMBLEDORE, Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes.,4,male
2797,DUMBLEDORE," (Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort. The ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so I think would be an insult to his memory. Now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that and Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. And we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end.",4,male
2798,DUMBLEDORE," I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry.",4,male
2799,DUMBLEDORE, Priorium Contatum. You saw your parents that night didn't you? They reappeared. ,4,male
2800,DUMBLEDORE," No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone.",4,male
2801,IGOR, Albus!,4,male
2802,IGOR, You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye.,4,male
2803,IGOR, I do sir.,4,male
2804,IGOR," I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier.",4,male
2805,IGOR, Dead?,4,male
2806,IGOR, I didn't know.,4,male
2807,IGOR," No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy.",4,male
2808,IGOR," Ya ya, the same. He passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself.",4,male
2809,IGOR," NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, Severus Snape.",4,male
2810,IGOR, It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord.,4,male
2811,IGOR, Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more.,4,male
2812,IGOR, The name...,4,male
2813,IGOR," I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and...",4,male
2814,IGOR, Barty Crouch! ... Junior.,4,male
2815,IGOR," It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I.",4,male
2816,MAD-EYE, That stupid roof.,4,male
2817,MAD-EYE, Alastor Moody.,4,male
2818,MAD-EYE," Ministry malcontent. And your new defence against the dark arts teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. But first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are?",4,male
2819,MAD-EYE, And they are so named?,4,male
2820,MAD-EYE," Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know what you're up against, you need to be prepared, you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk Mr Finnigan!",4,male
2821,MAD-EYE," So, which curse shall we see first? WEASLEY!",4,male
2822,MAD-EYE, Give us a curse.,4,male
2823,MAD-EYE," Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why.",4,male
2824,MAD-EYE, Hello. What a little beauty.,4,male
2825,MAD-EYE, Don't worry. Completely harmless.,4,male
2826,MAD-EYE, But if she bites... she's lethal!,4,male
2827,MAD-EYE, What are you laughing at?,4,male
2828,MAD-EYE, Talented isn't she? What shall I have her do next? Jump out the window? Drown herself?,4,male
2829,MAD-EYE," Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the imperious curse. But here's the rub, how do we sort out the liars? Another.. another.. Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up. ",4,male
2830,MAD-EYE, Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology.,4,male
2831,MAD-EYE, Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly nasty. The torture curse.,4,male
2832,MAD-EYE, Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse Miss Granger.,4,male
2833,MAD-EYE, The killing curse. Only one person is known to have survived it. And he's sitting in this room.,4,male
2834,MAD-EYE, Son. You alright?,4,male
2835,MAD-EYE," Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something.",4,male
2836,MAD-EYE," The hell he is. The goblet of fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object, only an exceptionally powerful conjurer could have hoodwinked it. Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year. ",4,male
2837,MAD-EYE, It was once my job to think as dark wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember? ,4,male
2838,MAD-EYE, I can do that.,4,male
2839,MAD-EYE, I'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned.,4,male
2840,MAD-EYE, Teaching.,4,male
2841,MAD-EYE, Technically it's a ferret.,4,male
2842,MAD-EYE, Is that a threat!,4,male
2843,MAD-EYE, I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair boy! It doesn't end here!,4,male
2844,MAD-EYE, He might've mentioned it.,4,male
2845,MAD-EYE, (To Harry) come with me.,4,male
2846,MAD-EYE, That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see the whites of their eyes they're standing right behind me.,4,male
2847,MAD-EYE, Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther. You wouldn't believe it if I did. Now... what are you going to do about your dragon?,4,male
2848,MAD-EYE," Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come on Potter. What are your strengths? ",4,male
2849,MAD-EYE, Better than fair the way I heard it. ,4,male
2850,MAD-EYE, You're allowed a wand.,4,male
2851,MAD-EYE," Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger.",4,male
2852,MAD-EYE, Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!,4,male
2853,MAD-EYE, Why don't you help Potter put his books back.,4,male
2854,MAD-EYE, (To Harry) Put that in your mouth. ,4,male
2855,MAD-EYE, Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we? Last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out!,4,male
2856,MAD-EYE, And they say I'm mad.,4,male
2857,MAD-EYE," Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private.",4,male
2858,MAD-EYE, (To Dumbledore) Yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't he.,4,male
2859,MAD-EYE, Champions! Prepare yourselves.,4,male
2860,MAD-EYE, Are you alright Potter?,4,male
2861,MAD-EYE, Does it hurt?,4,male
2862,MAD-EYE, I'd better take a look at it.,4,male
2863,MAD-EYE, What was it like? What was he like? ,4,male
2864,MAD-EYE, The dark lord. What was it like to stand in his presence?,4,male
2865,MAD-EYE," Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others?",4,male
2866,MAD-EYE, Marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? Do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric Diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if I hadn't have told him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom the witless wonder could have provided you with gilliweed if I hadn't have given him the book that led you straight to it? Huh?? ,4,male
2867,MAD-EYE, You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter. ,4,male
2868,MAD-EYE, Albus Dumbledore.,4,male
2869,MAD-EYE, No.,4,male
2870,NEVILLE, There's the um... The cruciatus curse. ,4,male
2871,NEVILLE, Amazing. Amazing.,4,male
2872,NEVILLE," Oh, right sorry.",4,male
2873,NEVILLE, Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.,4,male
2874,NEVILLE, You alright Harry? I just got in. Me! ,4,male
2875,NEVILLE," You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity resistant trees?",4,male
2876,NEVILLE, I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed.,4,male
2877,NEVILLE, Absolutely.,4,male
2878,NEVILLE, Most likely.,4,male
2879,NEVILLE, Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of freshwater versus saltwater.,4,male
2880,NEVILLE, I just wanted to help.,4,male
2881,NEVILLE, You seem a little tense Harry.,4,male
2882,NEVILLE, Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter! ,4,male
2916,SIR, (VOICEOVER) Harry. I couldn't risk sending Edward. It was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised. We need to talk Harry. Face to face. Meet me in the Griffindore common room at one o clock this Saturday night and make sure you're alone. P.S....,4,male
2917,SIR, (VOICEOVER CONT'D) The bird bites. ,4,male
2918,SIR, I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire?,4,male
2919,SIR," Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room?",4,male
2920,SIR, You didn't hear a name?,4,male
2921,SIR, What was that?,4,male
2922,SIR," Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't safe any more.",4,male
2923,SIR," I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater. And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban. ",4,male
2924,SIR, I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament.,4,male
2925,SIR, You don't have a choice.,4,male
2926,SIR, Keep your friends close Harry.,4,male
2927,DUDLEY," Oh,  it's  you.",5,male
2928,DUDLEY, Shut up!,5,male
2929,DUDLEY," Ooo, tough guy. Not so tough in your bed, are you?",5,male
2930,DUDLEY," I heard you talking in your sleep, last  night. Crying.  ""No,  don't  kill Cedric,  don't  kill Cedric!  Dad, help  me,  heeelp  me!  He's  going to kill me! Boo-hoo!""",5,male
2931,DUDLEY, Why should I?,5,male
2932,DUDLEY, Don't point that thing at me!,5,male
2933,DUDLEY, G-go home! What?,5,male
2934,DUDLEY, Get  out  of  here!,5,male
2935,DUDLEY, Don't point that thing at me!,5,male
2936,DUDLEY, What's  happening?,5,male
2937,HARRY," Big  D?  Cool  name,  but  to  me,  you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums.",5,male
2938,HARRY," What? You  boys  go  home  now,  or  I'll  be calling your parents!",5,male
2939,HARRY," Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you...",5,male
2940,HARRY, Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!,5,male
2941,HARRY," Not  so  brave  now,  are  you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go away.",5,male
2942,HARRY, Don't you ever speak about that again. You understand?,5,male
2943,HARRY," I SAID, DO YOU UNDERS'IAND?!",5,male
2944,HARRY, Quiet!,5,male
2945,HARRY, Dudley! Run!,5,male
2946,HARRY, Come on!,5,male
2947,HARRY," Dudley, no!",5,male
2948,HARRY," Lumos! 'Expecto  Patronum!' Bow to death, Harry... Haaaaaaaarry!... 'EXPECTO  PATRONUM!'",5,male
2949,HARRY," Dementors. What  happened,  Duddikins?",5,male
2950,HARRY, No.,5,male
2951,HARRY, We were attacked.,5,male
2952,HARRY," They're evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through  your  mouth. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban.",5,male
2953,HARRY, Because I used magic to save his life!,5,male
2954,HARRY, Lumos!,5,male
2955,HARRY," Nox. What  are  you  doing  here? We're  your  advanced  guard,  Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he  heard about  the  attack.  We're taking  you  to  safety. We're  just waiting  for  the  all  clear. How'd he know? It just happened! You  didn't  think  Dumbledore'd  let you  wander around  on  your  own,  did you? Harry,  I  don't  believe  you've  met Nymphadora Tonks. Tonks,  would  you  go  get  Harry's broom from the house?",5,male
2956,HARRY," What's  been  going  on?  What's  Lord Vol- We're  not  talking  about  it  here, it's too risky. Blast it. Mad-eye, dear, you do realize that's disgusting? I want 365 degree visibility on the return trip.",5,male
2957,HARRY," Brooms. Right, let's go. On  your  broom,  Harry. Form  up!  Form  up  around  Harry.  Make it snappy! We'll  be  flying  in  close-quarters formation. Tonks will be right in front of you, keep close to her at all times. Don't  stop,  and  whatever  you  do, don't break formation. If any of us are killed, the rest of you, keep flying. If that were to happen, the survivors, fly to the east. The rear guard is standing by. They will find you. Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye. We must be ready. This would be the perfect moment  for  Voldemort  to strike Harry.",5,male
2958,HARRY," Uh,  is  that  very  likely? No one's going to die. There's the second signal! Mount  your  brooms,  everyone.  Here we go! The  third  signal,  everyone.  Let's go! Stay in formation! We need more height! Contacts to the south! Mad-eye! You, Tonks, and Lupin take Harry!  We'll slow  them  down! There's the other one, Alastor!",5,male
2959,HARRY," Expecto--! Harry,  leave  it  to  us!",5,male
2960,HARRY," No! 'Expecto  Patronum!' Get  Harry  to  the  safe  house! Come on, Potter! Keep moving!",5,male
2961,HARRY," But  I  can  help! Potter,  getting  yourself  killed won't  do  a thing.  Now  move! We're  not  far,  now! Did  you  get  rid  of  them? They're gone, Alastor. We're  there! Prepare for descent! Form up around Harry! Stay here, Harry. Clear! Right, Harry, this way. Here, read this. Come on, inside. Hurry. Get  in,  quick,  Harry.  Don't  touch anything. Filth!  Scum!  Half-breeds,  mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers?! Shut  up,  you  miserable  old  hag! Quiet! Blood  traitor,  abomination,  shame of my flesh! Yes, yes, do shut up!",5,male
2962,HARRY," Was that your--? Mother,  yes.  Dear  old  mum.",5,male
2963,HARRY," But...why  here? This  house  has  been  my  family's  for centuries. It's  mine  now. I'm  the  last  of  the  Blacks.  I offered it up as headquarters for, well,  and  Dumbledore  accepted. It's about the most useful thing I've been  able  to do  for  a  long  while. Hello,  Harry  dear.",5,male
2964,HARRY," Mrs. Weasley! Sirius, the meeting is about to start! Right. Harry,  dear,  go  on  upstairs- quietly, if you please. They're all up there.",5,male
2965,HARRY," Right. He thought you would be safest there. Yeah, real safe. Attacked by Dementors, that's safe, that is. He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary... So,  why's  he  keeping  me  in  the dark?",5,male
2966,HARRY," Didn't you bother asking? We've only seen him twice, and not for  very long.  He's  really  busy. So I get to spend the summer with the  Dursleys while  you  two  are here. It's  not  that  fun,  mate.  Mum  won't let  us anywhere  near  the  meetings. You've still been here! What's  been  going  on? We've already told you, we're not privyed  to  the meetings.  But  we  do know  a  few  things. Some of the Order are following known  Death Eaters,  like  Lucious Malfoy. And  they're  guarding  something. What's  this  Order  everyone's talking about? The  Order  of  the  Phoenix. Dumbledore  started it  last  time  to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term. You can come down now, the meeting's over. Arthur- Well,  the  Ministry  is  furious  with you. You  did  magic  in  front  of  your muggle cousin. to  go  to  an disciplinary  meeting tomorrow. Okay. Harry stands up. I'm  not  really  hungry.  I  think  I'll go to bed. You  surprise  me,  Harry.  I  figured the first thing you'd do is start asking  about  Voldemort. I  wanted  to,  but  I  didn't  think you'd tell me anything. And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young-- He  has  a  right  to  know,  Molly. It's not your decision! I know what Dumbledore said, but he needs  to know  something. Yeah. He's  not  a  child,  Molly. He's  not  an  adult  either! (pause) He's  not  James. I'm  fully  aware  of  who  he  is, Molly. I  only  have  Harry's  best  interests at heart. He's  not  your  son. Who else does he have, then? He's  got  me.  He's  like  a  son  to me. What  do  you  want  to  know,  Harry?",5,male
2967,HARRY," Where's  Voldemort?  What's  he  doing? He's   hiding   for   the  moment,  because the Ministry  is  ignoring  his  return and he doesn't want that to change. You really messed things up for him last year, Harry.",5,male
2968,HARRY, How? The last person You-Know-Who wanted to  alert was  Dumbledore.,5,male
2969,HARRY," And  what's  his  plan? He's  building  up  his  army  again, just like before.",5,male
2970,HARRY," And  you're  stopping  him  from gaining followers? We're  doing  our  best,  but  it's proving to be...difficult. You see, when the Ministry of Magic insists that  Voldemort  isn't  back.",5,male
2971,HARRY," But...why? Fudge  likes  being  Minister  of Magic.  If  it  turns  out  that Voldemort came  back  under  his watch,  he'll be  sacked.",5,male
2972,HARRY," But  you're  telling  people,  right? Well,  they  think  I'm  a  mass- murderer, Lupin  is  a  werewolf, Tonks and Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry... But  Dumbledore  is  doing  all  he  can. If  he  keeps  it  up,  he  might  end  up in Azkaban. And that would give You- Know-Who a clear field to--",5,male
2973,HARRY, What? You-Know-Who  wants  something. Something  he didn't  have  last  time. A  weapon.,5,male
2974,HARRY," What  kind  of  weapon? I'm  sorry,  Harry,  we  can't  say anything more. Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep?",5,male
2975,HARRY, nerves...,5,male
2976,HARRY, Yeah...nerves...,5,male
2977,HARRY," Thanks, Hermione. What  does  he  get  a  hug  for?",5,male
2978,HARRY," Bye. Good, good, not very many Muggles. Well,  come  on  Harry,  in  we  go. I do love using the Fellytone! Now, let's see, what's the number again... Welcome  to  the  Ministry  of  Magic. Please state your business.",5,male
2979,HARRY," Department of Mysteries? Yep, I've got no idea what they get up to in here, it's top secret.",5,male
2980,HARRY," I've been there before... Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely... There  you  are,  Harry,  in  you go...good luck... You're late.",5,male
2981,HARRY," Er...sorry. No  matter,  the  accused  will  take his seat. Very well, we are ready to begin. Witness  for  the  Defence,  Albus Percival Wulfric  Brian  Dumbledore. Ah...you...er...got  our  message that  the  time  had changed,  did  you? have  missed  it. However, due to a fortunate mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. The charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: That the accused did with deliberation and fore-knowledge of the illegality of his actions, produce a patronus charm in full sight  of  a  Muggle. You are Harry James Potter?",5,male
2982,HARRY, Yes. And you conjured a patronus on the night of the eleventh of August?,5,male
2983,HARRY," Yes, but- Within full sight of a Muggle?",5,male
2984,HARRY," Yes, but-",5,male
2985,HARRY, Yes.,5,male
2986,HARRY," I think so, yeah.",5,male
2987,HARRY, My parents.,5,male
2988,HARRY," I  miss  them,  Sirius... I  know,  Harry,  I  know.  I  miss  them too. It's not fair that I got to spend so  much  time with  them  and  you didn't...",5,male
2989,HARRY," Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why? I  don't  know,  Harry.  I  wish  I  did, but I don't... I know I'm not your father, Harry, but I'll always be there for you, if I can help it...",5,male
2990,HARRY," Thanks. That mudblood with the scar, he cries, why does he cry so...? Kreacher,  get  out  of  here!  Now! Oh,  how  the  old  Mistress  would  weep to see the traitor in her house... Who..who  was  that? Kreacher.  He's  been  alone  with  the house for years, he's gone a bit funny. You'd better get some rest.",5,male
2991,HARRY," I'm  sure.  Nothing. So...congratulations  Ron, Hermione...",5,male
2992,HARRY," Yes, do go enjoy yourselves. What  is that? What? That...that...thing! Harry,  there's  nothing  there, mate...",5,male
2993,HARRY," Yes it is, it's right there! I see them too, Harry.",5,male
2994,HARRY, Er...you are? Luna. Luna Lovegood.,5,male
2995,HARRY," Well,  thanks  Luna.",5,male
2996,HARRY, Hagrid's  cabin  looks  deserted.,5,male
2997,HARRY," Yeah, could be. I beg a few moments of  your attention, as I have a few start of term announcements. Right off, our caretaker, the good Mr.  Filch, has reminded me for what he says is the four-hundred  and sixty-second  time that he  had  an  annually updated list of  various  banned  items, usually introduced by our humour experts  Fred  and George  Weasley... ...which are posted in an extensive list on the door to Mr.  Filch's door. Also, we have two staffing changes this year. Professor Grubby-Plank will be taking the post of Care of Magical Creatures post as Professor Hagrid is on...extended leave. Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge,  who has  kindly  agreed  to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts- Hem,  hem,  Headmaster,  if  I  could address the school? Thank  you,  Headmaster.  Now,  how  are we all doing tonight? I thought I would  just  say  a  few words.  I  am here  at  the  Ministry  of  Magic's bequest, under Educational Decree twenty-two, which states that if the  Headmaster  of  Hogwarts is unable to fill any teaching post the  Ministry shall  select  one  for the position. The  Ministry  has  always  considered the magical  education  of  our children to be of vital importance, and the passing down of  this ancient and noble art must be given to the next generation, lest it be lost forever... Without  progress,  stagnation.  But progress for progress's sake is to be discouraged, for our art requires no tinkering. A balance must be attained, the new and the old, permanence and change, tradition and innovation, order and chaos. There are large changes coming soon, changes walking the fine line between order and chaos. Know only that these changes are for  the best, and to prevent  the destruction of our civilization from its own decay. Thank you. So  why  didn't  your  mum  want  you  to come back  to  Hogwarts,  Seamus?",5,male
2998,HARRY, What?,5,male
2999,HARRY, Why?,5,male
3000,HARRY, What  did  I  do?,5,male
3001,HARRY, Where'd  she  get  that  from?,5,male
3002,HARRY, So...she  believes  this  stuff?,5,male
3003,HARRY," But...but  you  believe  me,  don't you? No  one  believes  me,  Hedwig.  No one... I'm  alone...",5,male
3004,HARRY," Sorry,  Professor...",5,male
3005,HARRY, What  about  Lord  Voldemort?,5,male
3006,HARRY," Yes, Professor. Good. Off you go. How can Dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? And when we're taking our OWL tests too! You reckon she's here to spy on us? Well,  not  us  specifically,  but definitely Dumbledore and the Order. Well,  way  to  go,  Potter.  Your detention is at the same time as Quidditch practice! Oh!  Sorry... Yeah,  well,  you're  going  to  have  to get out of it somehow.  We're holding tryouts for Keeper now Wood's gone, and I wanted to have the whole team there.",5,male
3007,HARRY," I'll never get out of it, Angelina.",5,male
3008,HARRY," Later,  I've  got  detention.",5,male
3009,HARRY, Thanks.,5,male
3010,HARRY, There's no ink.,5,male
3011,HARRY," No,  I  haven't.",5,male
3012,HARRY," No! I  don't  need  his  help.  I  don't  need anyone's help. Hagrid's still not back yet. I hope he's all right. I've asked Sirius about it. Harry,  you  can't  write  to  him!  Owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe. Don't  worry,  Hermione,  I  wrote  it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to  tell  someone  about Umbridge.  My scar hurt again last night in detention. Always knew she was a bit fishy. You think she's working for You- Know-Who?",5,male
3013,HARRY," Well,  it's  a  possibility,  isn't  it?",5,male
3014,HARRY," Sturgis Podmore? Wait,  he's  one  of  the  Order!",5,male
3015,HARRY, You  go  on  without  me.  I  want  to send this.,5,male
3016,HARRY, Hedwig! Oh...hi.  Didn't  think  anyone  else would be up here. Have you found a new Keeper for Quiddich?,5,male
3017,HARRY," Yeah, my friend Ron Weasley. He any good?",5,male
3018,HARRY," Well,  he  made  the  team.  I  missed the tryouts. Yeah,  Umbridge.  You  were  really brave, standing up to her.",5,male
3019,HARRY," Yeah...well,  it  was  the  truth. Right,  Potter.  I'll  have  what you're sending.",5,male
3020,HARRY, What? I have had a tip-off that you are ordering a large quantity of Dungbombs! Now hand it over.,5,male
3021,HARRY," You're too late, it's gone. Yeah,  I  saw  him  send  it. I get a single whiff of a Dungbomb in this castle, Potter...and you're mine. Um,  you  weren't  ordering  dungbombs, were you?",5,male
3022,HARRY," No. I  wonder  why  he'd  think  you  were. (pause) Well,  see  you,  Harry.",5,male
3023,HARRY," Get  bent,  Malfoy! No,  he's  right.  I'm  useless  out there. Complete  rubbish. It's  your  first  practice.  Don't worry about it. I'm  gonna  make  a  fool  of  myself  out there.",5,male
3024,HARRY," Yeah. Its just...the pain's getting stronger. I  don't  know  how  we're  ever  going to pass our O.W.L.s in Defense against  the  dark  arts without  any practice!  That  Umbridge  woman is so... We've got to do something about her. Yeah,  well,  poison  should  do  the trick. Don't  be  silly,  Ron.  Not  her,  I meant her teaching. We're not going to learn anything in that class. Yeah, that's true. Anyway, I thought we should do it ourselves. Do what? Defense  Against  the  Dark  Arts.  We'd teach ourselves. I  don't  know... Hermes?",5,male
3025,HARRY," Read it. ""Dear Ron, congratulations on becoming a Prefect. For some time I was worried you would take the 'Fred and George' route instead of following in my footsteps. You can imagine my relief that this is not the case.""",5,male
3026,HARRY," Letter from Percy. Yeah, full of the usual rubbish.",5,male
3027,HARRY," Why? He's  worried  Dumbledore  is  trying to turn the students against the Ministry. Well,  that  would  explain  why Umbridge  isn't teaching  us  anything useful  in  Defense  Against the  Dark Arts. Exactly.  The  Ministry  doesn't  want you trained  in  combat. What  does  he  think  Dumbledore  is going to do, raise an army? That's exactly what he's worried about. Fudge is getting more paranoid about Dumbledore every day.",5,male
3028,HARRY, What  do  you  know  about  Umbridge? She's a nasty piece of work. Apparently  she  hates part-humans.,5,male
3029,HARRY," Could she be a Death Eater? The  Order  seriously  doubts  it. She's no picnic, but she's no Death Eater either.",5,male
3030,HARRY," But  she's  evil. The world isn't split into the Order and the Death Eaters, Harry. As  to  your  question  about  Hagrid, well,  no one  is  really  sure  what happened to him, actually. He was supposed  to  be  back  a  while ago.",5,male
3031,HARRY," Er... Perhaps you are not as in the beyond as the others. Well,  if  that's  the  best  you  can do, Professor, I will be going. Where are we going, Hermione?",5,male
3032,HARRY," Hermione,  what's  going  on?",5,male
3033,HARRY," You mean about us teaching ourselves? Hey, Harry.",5,male
3034,HARRY," Hey, Neville. It's good to see that the horned snorkle-stacks haven't  gotten  you yet, Harry.",5,male
3035,HARRY," Uh...same  to  you,  Luna.",5,male
3036,HARRY," It's okay, Hermione.",5,male
3037,HARRY," I  believe  Voldemort's  back  because I  fought him  last  year. Dumbledore's already told the school that. If you didn't believe him  you  won't  believe  anyone. Well...anyway...uh,  I  think  that  in order  to  learn properly  we'll  need a teacher. But  we're  all  students.  None  of  us has the experience to-- Someone here does.",5,male
3038,HARRY," Me? I for one would like to know why Potter's qualified and the rest of us aren't. Well,  he's  only  confronted  You-Know- Who himself  four  times  and  lived  to talk about it. One of the portraits said you'd killed a Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets with that sword in Dumbledore's office.",5,male
3039,HARRY," Uh...well,  yeah,  I  did. Blimey, Harry... Wow... Can't forget that he saved the Sorcerer's  Stone from  You-Know-Who in his first year. And last year he got through the Triwizard Tournament! Not  to  mention  you  dueled  with  You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn't kill you! And you fought off those dementors that attacked  you  this  summer. So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry?",5,male
3040,HARRY, That might work. I'll look into that.,5,male
3041,HARRY, Yeah.,5,male
3042,HARRY, What's  she  done  now?,5,male
3043,HARRY," She knows. She can't! Look, we don't know how many people could have  overheard  our  meeting and told her. Or  somebody  at  the  meeting  could have blabbed to her. No,  they  couldn't  have.  The parchment  we  all signed  was enchanted, like I said. No one can betray  the  D.A.  without  us  knowing. What  would  we  do  without  you, Hermione? Hedwig! She's hurt! She doesn't look very good. Harry,  you'd  better  take  her  to Professor Grubby-Plank.  She'll  know what to do. Potter! Where on earth are you going at this time of night? It's  Hedwig.  I  think  she's  been attacked. What? Yes, I think you might be right, Potter.",5,male
3044,HARRY," London. Well,  give  her  to  me.  I'll  run  her down to Professor Grubby-Plank. There you are. Bear in mind, Potter, that channels of communication  in  and  out  of Hogwarts  are being  watched,  won't you?",5,male
3045,HARRY," Yes, Professor. Good. Now, off to bed.",5,male
3046,HARRY, Dobby!  What  are  you  doing  here?,5,male
3047,HARRY," What  is  it,  Dobby.",5,male
3048,HARRY," Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't  think you  can  help  me.",5,male
3049,HARRY," Actually,  there  is  something  you can do, Dobby.",5,male
3050,HARRY, I need a room where twenty-eight people  can practice  Defense  Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge.,5,male
3051,HARRY," That's brilliant, Dobby! Dobby can show you now, if you wish, Harry Potter. Better  not,  Dobby.  School  is  pretty intense right  now.  We'll do it in a few months, before the  holidays. ...and Slytherin is up forty to ten. Alica with the quaffle! Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He  always  lets  the  Quaffle  in, Weasley is our King! Just ignore them, Ron! Another ten points to  Slytherin. The score is now fifty-ten in favor of Slytherin.",5,male
3052,HARRY, Ban us...for life.,5,male
3053,HARRY," You've--! My hands are tied, Potter. I  can't  believe  it...three  players banned for life in one day... I'm  going  to  resign.",5,male
3054,HARRY," You can't! I'm  horrible!  I  should  never  have joined. If  you  quit,  we'll  be  out  four players! This is the worst day of my life.",5,male
3055,HARRY," Hagrid, what happened to you? I've fine, I tell yeh! Come  off  it,  Hagrid!  We're  not blind!",5,male
3056,HARRY," What  happened  then? We  sat  down,  an'  had  a  talk.  Well, mostly they  listened  good.  But there were good signs. Well,  they  did  'till  tha'  night. Tha's  when everythin'  went  wrong. There were a coup. Nex' mornin' there were a new chief. We went back ter see what we could do with this new chief. An'  then  things  got  even  worse. Death Eaters arrived, an' the new chief were all happy ter be seein' them! We  figured,  jus'  cause  some  o'  the giants were favorin' You-Know-Who don't  mean  all  of  'em were.  The coup ha' driven the ol' chief's supporters into some caves, so we wen' in after 'em. You went into caves looking for giants? We foun' enough, an' they seemed interested--at first. Then the new chief's lot raided the caves. Tweren't  many  survivors,  an'  none o' them wanted anythin' to do with us after tha'. So...no  giants  are  coming? Well,  not  righ'  away.  We  brought our message,   an'   I   expec'   a   fair  few'll remember it afore teh end comes. Glad to see all of you could find this place all right. Hey, Harry, what is all this stuff? Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment.  Hopefully  we'll  be able to get to all of it before the end  of  term. You need to understand something before we start, though. Defending yourself from the Dark Arts has less  to  do  with  magical  ability  and more to do with thinking fast and a lot of luck. We'll  be  doing  Expelliarmus tonight, though hopefully we can move on to other things if we have time. Oh please. Professor Lockhart taught us that in second year. Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune  himself. Besides,  it  works.  I  used  it against You-Know-Who last June. It saved my life.",5,male
3057,HARRY," Right.  Well,  let's  split  into  pairs and give it a go. Expelliarmus!",5,male
3058,HARRY," Well  done,  Neville!",5,male
3059,HARRY," Look here, you lot! Neville's really got the hang of this one. ahead again. Expelliarmus! I did it! I did it!",5,male
3060,HARRY," Never  forget  this  spell,  Neville. It could save your live some day.",5,male
3061,HARRY," Okay,  everyone.  We've  done  a  lot today, and I've seen some great improvement.  That's it  for  now. We'll  meet  back  here,  same time next week! What's  wrong  with  him? Get  McGonagall!  Go! Harry! HARRY! Potter! Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please...",5,male
3062,HARRY," Mr.  Weasley's  been  attacked! You dreamed this, Potter?",5,male
3063,HARRY," No,  I  saw  it  happen!  I...I  was there... You're sure this happened, Potter?",5,male
3064,HARRY," Yes! We've got to do something or he will die! We're  going  to  see  the  Headmaster, Potter. Weasley, you'd best come too. Professor  McGonagall,  and...ah... What  can  I  do  for  you? Well,  Potter  has  had  some  kind  of nightmare... It  wasn't  a  nightmare!  Well,  I  was asleep,  but it  wasn't  a  normal dream.  It  was...well,  real.  I saw, well--Mr.  Weasley  has  been  attacked by a giant snake. How did you see this? How were you positioned when you saw it? Oh.  Uh...I  was  the  snake.  I  saw  it from the snake's perspective. Is Arthur seriously injured?",5,male
3065,HARRY, Yes! You were listening?,5,male
3066,HARRY," Sirius, I-- You  can  tell  me,  Harry.",5,male
3067,HARRY," When I saw the attack, well, I was the snake. I felt the fangs like they were mine, saw through the snake's eyes like  they  were  mine...",5,male
3068,HARRY, I  think  I  might  be  going  mad. Nonsense.  You're  just  tired.  You've had a rough night.,5,male
3069,HARRY, But  what  if  there's  a  snake  inside me? You've told Dumbledore this? (off Then there's nothing to worry about. We're  here  to  see  Arthur  Weasley.,5,male
3070,HARRY, There's no need--,5,male
3071,HARRY," Uh,  sure... Ah,  there  you  went,  Gildroy. He keeps wandering off, handing out autographs, don't you know? It's a good sign toward recovering his memory, the poor dear. Yeah, sorry about that, mate.",5,male
3072,HARRY," I have to. You  know,  I  thought  Gryffindors  had to be brave. I  won't  hurt  anybody  else. I see. You are running away out of nobility. You know, that's why I hated teaching. Young people always think  they  know  what's  best,  as  if no one else could possibly understand things better. I've  brought  a  message  from Dumbledore.",5,male
3073,HARRY," What  is  it? Dumbledore says, 'Stay where you are.' That's  it?  Stay  there  while  the grown-ups sort things out? When in all your life has listening  to Dumbledore ever led you into trouble? Whatever his reasons, he has your best interests at heart, Potter. Fine!  Go!  And  tell  Dumbledore thanks for nothing!",5,male
3074,HARRY," Get  out! No. Ginny,  I'm  dangerous.  You  can't  be around me. Did you forget that I've been possessed by You-Know-Who before?",5,male
3075,HARRY," I forgot. Lucky  you.  Anyway,  that's  what  I wanted to talk to you about. Can you remember everything you've done this year? There aren't any blank spots in your memory?",5,male
3076,HARRY," No,  I  don't  think  so. Then You-Know-Who has never possessed  you,  Harry. I  don't  know  what's  going  on  with you right now, but possession's not one  of  them.  You're not  dangerous.",5,male
3077,HARRY," Thanks, Ginny. Don't mention it. Harry,  have  you  seen  Kreacher?  I haven't seen  him  for  days  now.",5,male
3078,HARRY," Haven't  seen  him. Oh  well.  Maybe  he's  crawled  up  into the  air ducts  and  died...mustn't get my hopes up though. Potter, excellent. I'd like a word. Sit, Potter. You  know,  I  don't  like  people giving orders in my house. How unfortunate for you. Now kindly get out. My instructions from Dumbledore are to talk with Potter alone. I'm  his  godfather.  I  think  I'll stay. Very  well,  then.  I  know  how  you like to pretend you're useful. It  is  the  Headmaster's  wish  that  I teach  you Occlumency,  Potter.",5,male
3079,HARRY," What's  that? Occlumency.  It  is  an  ancient  form of magic that allows you to defend your mind from external intrusion. We begin at six-o-clock on Monday, Potter. Well,  unlike  Sirius  here,  I  don't have unlimited leisure time. Just  a  second,  Snape.  If  I  hear that you're using this to give Harry a hard time, you'll have me to answer to. How touching. Yet Potter is incredibly like his father. Criticism  simply  bounces  off  of him. I've warned you, Snivellus. Dumbledore may think you've reformed,  but  I  know  better... Touch me one more time, Black, and you  won't touch  anything  again. Hi,  Harry. Hi. Er...bye then.",5,male
3080,HARRY," Hey Cho! Well,  uh,  Valentine's  Day  is  the same day as our next Hogsmead visit. Well,  uh,  would  you  like  to,  you know, go with me? Sit, Potter. As  you  are  well  aware,  I  will  be teaching  you Occlumency.  The headmaster feels you should learn this  form  of  magic  to  defend yourself against the Dark Lord, who is  skilled  at Legilimency. What's  that,  Professor? Legilimency is the ability to extract  thoughts and  feelings  from others.",5,male
3081,HARRY," Voldemort  can  read  minds? As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, Potter. The mind is not a book, of which any page can be examined. The mind is  complex  and multi-layered. So he could read our minds right now? Eye contact is normally required for  Legilimency to  work.  In  your case,  however,  things  are somewhat different. Your scar has forged a connection between you and the Dark Lord. When your mind is most relaxed, such as during sleep, you receive the Dark Lord's thoughts and feelings. The Headmaster believes that it is inadvisable for this to continue. But  hasn't  it  helped  so  far?  I mean,  it  saved Mr.  Weasley's  life, didn't it? Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. The connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of it. The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you through false visions. Wand out, Potter. You may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me.",5,male
3082,HARRY, What  are  you  going  to  do? I am going to break into your mind. (pause) Legimens!,5,male
3083,HARRY," NO! Well,  you  stopped  me  eventually. Ideally, you should repel me with your mind. Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon your emotions. Legilimens!",5,male
3084,HARRY," Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely... What  was  that?",5,male
3085,HARRY," I've just realized... Realized what, Potter?",5,male
3086,HARRY," What's  in  the  Department  of Mysteries,  sir? What  did  you  say? That corridor, I've been dreaming about  it  for months...it  leads  to the  Department  of Mysteries,  I'm sure of it. There are many things in the Department  of Mysteries,  Potter, none of which concern you. You  cannot  sack  me!",5,male
3087,HARRY," Voldemort. Hi,  Harry! Have  fun,  Harry.  Meet  me  in  The Three Broomsticks after. There's something you need to do.",5,male
3088,HARRY," Ok. You  know,  Cedric  and  I  came  here last year. Before... I--I've been meaning to ask you for ages...but...I  mean...",5,male
3089,HARRY," What? Did--did Cedric say anything about me before he...he--died? Oh.  Uh,  no,  there  wasn't  really much time... Look, maybe we should talk about something else... I thought you'd want to talk about it! I thought you'd understand! See you around, Harry. What's  this  all  about? That's  what  Little  Miss  Perfect  was about to tell us. Right,  well,  I  figured  that  with all of the negative press out about Harry,  he  should  have a  chance  to defend himself. All  of  the  details.  What  happened last  summer. The  truth  about  Sirius Black  and  Voldemort, not  to  mention the names of all the Death Eaters still on the loose. The Prophet will  never  publish that. Goes against the public mood. Well,  it  doesn't  matter.  We've found a publisher for the article. Who? My father. He's the editor of The Quibbler. The  Quibbler? You think people will take Harry Potter seriously if he's published in the Quibbler? It's nothing but a conspiracy theory, cock-and-bull story tabloid! Some  won't  believe  Harry,  that's true.  But every  person  we  do convince is one more ally. So,  Harry.  Ready  to  tell  the  public the truth?",5,male
3090,HARRY," Yeah, I guess so.",5,male
3091,HARRY, What  on  earth?,5,male
3092,HARRY, What?,5,male
3093,HARRY," We've been doing so well, I thought we'd work on some defensive blocking spells tonight.",5,male
3094,HARRY, That was really good.,5,male
3095,HARRY," What  is  it,  Dobby?",5,male
3096,HARRY," Who, Dobby?",5,male
3097,HARRY, Is  it  Umbridge?,5,male
3098,HARRY, Get  out  of  here!  Now!,5,male
3099,HARRY," Not  really,  no. You  don't?  You  haven't  broken  any school rules?",5,male
3100,HARRY, School rules? No. Or Ministerial Decrees?,5,male
3101,HARRY," Not  that  I  know  of. I'm  afraid  the  poor  girl  is  unable to speak. But I shall tell you what has transpired. Shortly after dinner she came to me and said that if I went to the Room of Requirement I would find an illegally-formed student group. It  was  at  that  time  that  this  hex took affect. Since I had received information some time ago that Potter and a number of other students had met in the Hog's Head to start an illegal group-- I'm  not  sure  that's  true, Professor. I'm  sorry? In point of fact, when young Potter met  those students  it  was  not illegal. But  two  days  later,  Educational Decree Twenty-Four was introduced. Again,  quite  correct.  However,  I wonder if you have any evidence that proves this group has been meeting since then?",5,male
3102,HARRY," Professor, no! Quiet,  Harry! Yes,  shut  up,  Potter.  So,  you'll  be coming  with us  to  the  Ministry-- Ah,  yes.  I  was  wondering  when  we'd hit that little snag. I see no snag, Dumbledore. But  I  do.  You  seem  to  be  laboring under the delusion that I would 'come  quietly.' Resisting arrest, now are you, Dumbledore? Precisely. You see, I have absolutely no intention of going to Azkaban. Don't  be  silly,  Hawkes.  Leave  the wand there. You   would   really   take   on   two Aurors, Dumbledore? Naturally. All of you did rather well  on  your spellwork  at  this school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I'm afraid I shall have to hurt you. Are you all right? Yes, we're fine. (pause) Oh,  where  will  you  go,  Albus? I'm  not  going  into  hiding.  Fudge will  soon regret  removing  me  from Hogwarts.",5,male
3103,HARRY," I'm  so  sorry,  Professor! It's  fine.  Now  listen  to  me,  Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do everything Professor Snape  tells you. Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Lay back down. They must not think we  have had  time  to  talk. Find him!",5,male
3104,HARRY," Thanks, Professor. You're  welcome,  Potter.  Now  hurry or  you'll be  late  for  Occlumency. Have you been practicing, Potter? Well,  we  shall  see,  won't  we? Excuse  me,  Professor.  Professor Umbridge says  she  needs  you  right away. What  on  earth  for?",5,male
3105,HARRY," No! Amusing  man,  your  father...",5,male
3106,HARRY," I--sorry! You  will  repeat  what  you  saw  to  no one! No,  of  course  not! You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you  will  wish  you  had  never been born! Now get out of my sight! Do not set foot in this office ever again! Today  begins  your  O.W.L  exams.  A number  of Ministry  instructors  are here  to  give  them. Exams  will  take place  for  the  next  two  weeks. Exams will be split in two parts,  theory and practical application. I must warn you that the most stringent anti-cheating spells have been added to your exam papers. No student has successfully cheated on an O.W.L.  in  a  century,  though every year someone tries it. Naturally,  cheating  will  not  be suffered and anyone caught will be expelled from Hogwarts. Oy!  That's  Umbridge  down  there!",5,male
3107,HARRY, They're heading for Hagrid's!,5,male
3108,HARRY," No! Be reasonable, Hagrid! Look! McGonagall'll  sort  this  out! How dare you! How DARE you! Stop  this immediately! Enough! Not  even  a  warning! COWARDS! Get  him,  get  him! Get  her  to  the  hospital  wing  right away. Before we begin, I have an update on  Professor McGonagall.  She  will be all right, and is resting in the hospital wing. You may now turn your papers over and begin. Can you reach it? Can you take it for  me, Black? I would rather die! Oh,  you  will  die.  Eventually.  But there are hours, even days of pain awaiting you before then. I'm  going  to  enjoy  this,  Black.  I have you, and soon I shall have the weapon. And then not even your pathetic Order can stand in my way! Are you all right, Potter? Pressure  of  exams.  It  happens.  Take a  breath, and  maybe  you'll  be  ready to go back in. Time is nearly up, but-- No--no, I've done all I can. You all right? Voldemort!  He's  got  Sirius!  In  the Department of Mysteries!",5,male
3109,HARRY, I just saw it.,5,male
3110,HARRY, How're we going to get there? To the Department of Mysteries?,5,male
3111,HARRY, We've got to do something!,5,male
3112,HARRY, I  won't  let  Sirius  die! We  heard  Harry  yelling.  What's  up?,5,male
3113,HARRY," Voldemort's  broken  into  the Department  of Mysteries.  He's  got Sirius there! He could already have the weapon! Think,  Harry!  Voldemort  knows  you! He knows you'd rush off to save Sirius.",5,male
3114,HARRY," There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone! Anything we can do to help?",5,male
3115,HARRY," No,  there  isn't!",5,male
3116,HARRY, How?,5,male
3117,HARRY," That's all we'll need. Right.  You've  got  ten  minutes  to get  to Umbridge's  office.  And whatever you do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours. Unless they spread, in which case, I'd get out of the castle for a while. Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry. Professor!  It's  those  Weasley twins! They've set something off in the  Astronomy  Tower! Ready to try out the old punishments again? They've had this coming for a long time! Grimmauld Place!",5,male
3118,HARRY," Sirius! Are you here! That was worth it! I've got you now! Thank you for playing, one and all.",5,male
3119,HARRY, Sirius! Lupin? Hello?,5,male
3120,HARRY," Kreacher,  where's  Sirius?",5,male
3121,HARRY," You know where he is, don't you?",5,male
3122,HARRY, But  you  know.,5,male
3123,HARRY, It's none of your business.,5,male
3124,HARRY," Hermione,  no!",5,male
3125,HARRY, I would rather die!,5,male
3126,HARRY," What  are  we  supposed  to  do  now? That's  just  what  we  were  wondering. So,  how  do  we  get  to  the  Ministry?",5,male
3127,HARRY," We've got no brooms. There are other ways to fly. I  mean,  they  can  fly,  and  they're very good at finding places you need to go.",5,male
3128,HARRY, What  are  those? What  are  what?,5,male
3129,HARRY," All right, then. Get on one, and we'll  be  off. And what about those of us who can't see  them? I'll show you. Never again... What  now,  Harry?",5,male
3130,HARRY," All right, come on. Department  of  Mysteries. Where is everyone? The  Ministry  closed  a  half-hour ago.  I expect  they  all  went  home.",5,male
3131,HARRY, That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed.,5,male
3132,HARRY, This is it. Come on.,5,male
3133,HARRY," Stay close. Now where? I  don't  understand.  In  my  dream, the  doors weren't  identical.",5,male
3134,HARRY, Yeah. I'll know the way when I see it.,5,male
3135,HARRY, Who's  there?,5,male
3136,HARRY, Sirius?,5,male
3137,HARRY," Does anyone else hear that? I  do.  It's  coming  from  the  Veil. Harry... There are people in there! What  do  you  mean,  people?",5,male
3138,HARRY," It's got my name on it! I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter.",5,male
3139,HARRY," Where's  Sirius? We  don't  have  him,  if  that's  what you  mean. You never did, did you? It was all just a trick. The Dark Lord knows your weakness for  heroics, Potter.  All  it  took was a little nudge to get you here.",5,male
3140,HARRY, What  prophesy? That prophesy. Now hand it over or we'll  have to  use  wands  on  you.,5,male
3141,HARRY," Go ahead. Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish?",5,male
3142,HARRY," Come and find out! Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here. I haven't escaped from Azkaban for this! No! If the prophesy is smashed-- Take  the  youngest  girl.  We'll  see how committed  Potter  is  as  we torture her. You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing. So,  what  kind  of  prophesy  are  we talking about here? Surely you jest, Potter? Not  really.  How  come  Voldemort wants it? You dare to speak the Dark Lord's name?",5,male
3143,HARRY," Who, Voldemort? Oh, yeah, I dare. Voldemort, voldemort,  Voldemort-- Silence! How dare you utter that name  from your  half-blood  mouth!",5,male
3144,HARRY," Hey,  did  you  know  Voldemort's  a half-blood too? Control yourself, Bellatrix!",5,male
3145,HARRY, What's  so  special  about  this prophesy anyway? You mean Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was hidden here?,5,male
3146,HARRY, What?,5,male
3147,HARRY," When I give the signal, blast the shelves... So that's what took you so long. We wondered. But  why  did  he  need  me  to  take  it? Only a person for whom the prophesy was  made can  remove  it  from  its self, Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly  couldn't  get  it  himself. So he used me to do his dirty work, did he? Precisely, Potter.",5,male
3148,HARRY, NOW!,5,male
3149,HARRY, RUN!,5,male
3150,HARRY, Where'd  the  rest  go?,5,male
3151,HARRY, Stupify! Avada-- Expelliarmus!,5,male
3152,HARRY, Stupify!,5,male
3153,HARRY, Ron! Impedimenta! We've got him!,5,male
3154,HARRY, Pretificus Totalus! Stupify!,5,male
3155,HARRY," Hermione! Please  don't  be  dead,  please  don't be dead...",5,male
3156,HARRY," Hermione,  wake  up... What's  they  do  to  her? She's alive, Harry. There's a pulse.",5,male
3157,HARRY, Can we carry her? I'll do it. You're better at fighting. Where  do  we go?,5,male
3158,HARRY," I  don't  know... What  happened. I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell... Hiyya,  Harry. funny They  hit  her  with  something  too. We  need  to  get  out  of  here.  Luna, can you help Ginny? There they are! Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over. Let my friends go and I will. You are not in a position to negotiate.",5,male
3159,HARRY," Stop, Neville! Neville?  Neville  Longbottom? My dear boy, I paid your parents a visit  a  long time  ago.  We  had  such a time! You  put  them  in  St.  Mungos! So,  Potter. Give us the Prophesy or I'll see how long it takes to crack Longbottom like his parents. Don't give it to them! Crucio!",5,male
3160,HARRY," Are you all right? Yeah... Give  me  the  prophesy! Get  out  of  here,  you  two! That  will  take  you  back  out  of  the Department  of  Mysteries.",5,male
3161,HARRY," You come with us! You're  the  important  one,  now, Harry.  I have  to  help  the  Order. I'll always be here for you, Harry. Now go! Hello,  cousin! Potter! We may  have lost the prophesy, but I can still deliver you to the Dark Lord! Stupify!",5,male
3162,HARRY," Protego! It's  Dumbledore! Is that the best you've got, cousin?",5,male
3163,HARRY, Sirius!,5,male
3164,HARRY, me go! Harry!  HARRY!...he's  gone...there's nothing you can do...,5,male
3165,HARRY, LIAR!,5,male
3166,HARRY," No...no...no Harry,  no! You  can't  stop  me,  Potter! Y I'LL  KILL  YOU!!",5,male
3167,HARRY," Stupify! Well,  well,  have  you  come  to  avenge your dear Godfather?",5,male
3168,HARRY," Crucio! Crucio! Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, Potter? You have to mean it, you have to want to cause the pain in your very soul... Give me the prophesy!",5,male
3169,HARRY," Can't.  It  got  smashed  by  accident! You lie! How's  Voldemort  going  to  like  that? You've failed  him,  and  he's  not very forgiving, is he? Forgive  me,  Master!  I  tried,  I-- He can't hear you from here, you know! Can't I, Potter? So,  you  smashed  my  prophesy... I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter! Avada Kadavra! You should not have come here tonight, Tom. It is you who made that mistake, Dumbledore! Avada Kedavra! You  do  not  seek  to  kill  me, Dumbledore? There are other ways to destroy a man,  Tom. There is nothing worse than death! You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been.",5,male
3170,HARRY, Look out!,5,male
3171,HARRY," Professor! Stay where you are, Harry! Kill  me  now,  Dumbledore...do  it,  if death means nothing... Harry! Are you all right, Harry? Minister,  I  saw  him!  You-Know-Who! He was right there! I  know...I  saw  him  too... If you and your men will proceed to the  Death Room,  you  will  find several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended. Seize him! Minister,  you  have  just  seen  You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds ago! It is time to come to your senses! If you insist on trying to arrest me,  I  am perfectly  willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be. Dumbledore, what the blazes happened here? I will explain everything, Minister.  Just  as  soon as  I  return Harry to school. What's he doing  here?  And  what's happened to him? Minister,  you  will  order  the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my school. Also,  she  will  probably  need medical attention, having had a violent encounter with some Centaurs earlier this evening. All  Educational  Decrees  will  be nullified and you will call off the search on Hagrid so he can return to work. I will return here later tonight, after  I  have  seen to  Harry.  It should not take long. Portus. Dumbledore, I want some answers! The Second War has begun, Minister. Thank you... Please  sit,  Harry. I understand how you feel, Harry--",5,male
3172,HARRY," No you don't! You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, Harry. There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry.  It  is your  greatest strength... You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know! What  can't  I  know? This  pain  is  part  of  being  human, Harry... Then I don't want to be human! I  don't  care!  I  don't  care! You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it.",5,male
3173,HARRY, Let me out. No.,5,male
3174,HARRY," You can't keep me in here! I daresay I can. And if you actually  do  attack me  with  that wand,  Harry,  I'm  afraid  to  say you will regret it. It is my fault Sirius died tonight. (pause) I have kept things from you, Harry. Things that I should not have concealed. You had a right to know, but I put off telling you. Had I told you that Voldemort might try to lure you down to the Department of Mysteries you would never have gone there tonight. Sirius would never have gone after you. That  fault  lies  with  me.  I  hope that you can find it in your heart  to forgive me one day. Harry,  I  owe  you  this  explanation, to show you the failings of an old man. Our  explanation  begins  with  your scar.  You already  know  that  it  is  a connection between  you  and Voldemort,  and  that  this connection goes  both  ways. I grew worried that Voldemort would at some point discover this connection,  which  he  did the  night Mr.  Weasely  was  attacked. I already know all this. Haven't   you   wondered   why   I   haven't spoken  to  you,  even  looked  at  you, for months? Well,  yeah,  I  did... I  was  worried  that  if  Voldemort discovered there was a closer relationship between us than simply between  teacher  and  student he would  use  you  to  spy  on  the  Order. Another mistake. Voldemort  showed  us  both  tonight that his  aim  in  possessing  you would  not  be to  destroy  me,  but  to destroy you. Sirius  told  me  you  believed  there was  a snake  inside  of  you.  This  was Voldemort attempting  to  manipulate you.  To  protect you  from  this,  I had you study Occlumency. But  Snape  stopped  giving  me lessons. Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed. He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort-- I  would  trust  Severus  Snape  with  my life, Harry.  You  have  never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year. Sirius  didn't  trust  him.  Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side... Again,  some  wounds  run  too  deep  to be healed, Harry.  Severus  and Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed. During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the Department  of  Mysteries. I've been dreaming about that all year,  before Voldemort  discovered the connection. Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. Because of  your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form  of dreams. Once  he  discovered  the  connection, Voldemort  had  little  difficulty  in manipulating  you  into  thinking  he had captured  Sirius. But  I  checked  Grimmauld  Place! Kreacher said-- Kreacher  lied.  He  wanted  you  to  go to the  Department  of  Mysteries.",5,male
3175,HARRY, Why? Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now.,5,male
3176,HARRY," What? It appears that when Sirius told him  to  get out,  Kreacher  thought  he meant  out  of  the house.  So  he  went to the Black's closest relatives, the  Malfoys. Obviously, they questioned him. Sirius  had forbidden  him  from giving  up  important secrets.  But Sirius had neglected to mention his relationship  with  you. He told them how you saw him as a mixture of  father  and  brother,  and that you would move heaven and earth to save Sirius. Voldemort  knew  that  making  you believe he  had  Sirius  in  the Department of Mysteries would force you  there. Wait,  where  was  Sirius  when  I  tried to contact him? Ah.  Apparently  Kreacher  had  injured Buckbeak  to  distract  him  in  case you  tried to  contact  Headquarters. Sirius was tending to the wounds when you called. And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher! She  was  quite  right,  Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him. He is to be pitied, not hated. Sirius hated him. He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of the home he had always hated. Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there! I was trying to save his life! It  is  time  to  tell  you  what  I should have five years ago. No doubt you have wondered why it was that I sent you there and not to a wizarding family? I did it for your protection. You were in more danger than anyone realized.  Voldemort  was defeated, but  his  servants  were  everywhere. I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his weakness.  There  is  an  ancient magic which  Voldemort  has  always underestimated. This  magic  is  what  your  mother  gave you when  she  died.  That  protection would  only work,  however,  if  you were cared for by a blood relative. Your  Aunt,  Petunia. She  never  loved  me. Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected. And  now  we  come  to  the  moment  of terrible  truth,  the  moment  I  have dreaded for  fifteen  years.  The moment  when  I  must lay  another burden atop your already straining shoulders. Do you remember your first year here? When  you  lay  in  the  hospital wing  fresh from  your  confrontation with Voldemort? Do you remember what you asked me that night? I  asked  you  why  Voldemort  tried  to kill me. Yes.  I  decided  not  to  tell  you then.  After all,  eleven  was  too young for such burdens. The same went for twelve. But I was running out  of  excuses  by  thirteen  and fourteen. Do  you  see  the  flaw  in  my plan yet? I  cared  about  you  too  much.  I became  more concerned  with  your happiness and well-being than with the truth and the lives it could save. That was my greatest  mistake. It was exactly what Voldemort expects  from  us  fools  who love. But  I  could  not  bear  to  tell  you.  I have watched you pass through greater trials than any other student in the history of this school, and I could not bear to add another one, the greatest one of all. You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. But unfortunately,  I  must.",5,male
3177,HARRY," I  don't  understand,  Professor. The reason Voldemort tried to kill you is because of a prophesy made just before your birth. By attempting to kill you, he believed he was fulfilling the terms of the prophesy.  Voldemort's  mistake was that he had not heard the entire prophesy. That is the weapon we have been guarding, and which he has been so desperately seeking: the knowledge of how to destroy you. Professor, why am I so important to him? An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy. Sir, it got smashed. That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved. ""The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches defied  him, born as the Seventh Month dies...and the  Dark  Lord  will  mark him  as  his  equal,  but he  will  have a power the Dark Lord knows not...and either must die at  the hand of the other for neither can live  while  the  other survives Dark Lord will be born as the Seventh Month dies..."" I'm  not  sure  I  understand  all  that, sir... It means that the only person with a  chance  of defeating  Voldemort  was born at the end of July to parents who had resisted him three times before.",5,male
3178,HARRY," And...it  means  me? Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring  to.  You and  Neville Longbottom. So  it's  not  necessarily  me,  sir? You  forget  the  next  qualification of  the prophesy.  The  Dark  Lord  will mark  this boy  as  his  equal. In  giving  you  that  scar,  Voldemort did so. I'm afraid  that  the prophesy is most certainly referring  to  you. What if he chose wrong? He  chose  the  child  he  believed  to be the more dangerous. He chose the ""half-blood"" wizard because he saw some  of  himself  in you. He  tried  to  kill  you  and  instead gave you the power and the future to destroy him. Why  didn't  he  wait?  Why  attack  when we were babies? Voldemort  had  an  informant listening  to  my meeting  with Professor Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the  entire  prophesy.  Voldemort had to  act  immediately,  he  didn't  know the rest of the prophesy. All  he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to  his  power. But  I  don't  have  any  special powers. There  is  a  room  in  the  Department of Mysteries  which  is  kept  locked at  all  times. It  contains  a  force so  wonderful  and  yet terrible  that it  is  greater  than  death  itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts  of  and  of  which Voldemort  has none. What is it, sir? This power drove you to save Sirius tonight. It  kept  Voldemort  from possessing  you,  he cannot  bear  to touch it. In the end, it was your heart and not  your head  that  saved  you. There  is  only  the  end  of  the prophesy which  we  haven't addressed.  It  states ""neither  can live  while  the  other survives."" It  is  the  final  burden  which  I  must place on you, Harry. One  of  us  has  to  kill  the other...in the end. Yes. Hello,  Harry.",5,male
3179,HARRY," Hey, Nick.",5,male
3180,HARRY, Oh.  Thanks.,5,male
3181,HARRY," Nick, I was wondering about something?",5,male
3182,HARRY, Expecting what?,5,male
3183,HARRY, I expect so...,5,male
3184,HARRY," Why? I am neither here nor there, Harry. Trapped between  two  worlds.  That does  not  appeal  to most. I know nothing of the secrets of death, Harry. I was afraid of it. I preferred to survive as a feeble imitation of life than  face  the vast unknown. I often wonder if that was a wise decision. I'm  sorry  I  couldn't  be  of  more help, Harry.  Truly  I  am.",5,male
3185,HARRY," How are you? Good  as  new,  mate.",5,male
3186,HARRY, I've got something to tell you. Something important.,5,male
3187,HARRY, But  not  right  now.  I'm  not  ready.,5,male
3188,HARRY, Do you need any help looking? Oh no. It all turns up in the end. Sirius Black. Hermione said he was your Godfather.,5,male
3189,HARRY, Yeah. Have you ever...you know... My  mother.  I  was  nine.,5,male
3190,HARRY, I'm  sorry. It's okay. It's not like I'll never see her again.,5,male
3191,HARRY," Isn't it? Don't tell me you didn't hear them. The  voices beyond  the  Veil? They were just out of sight, that's all.",5,male
3192,HARRY," You  mean  we'll  see  them  again? Of course. Things always work out, in the end.",5,male
3327,GEORGE," Personally, I envy you three. Why's  that?",5,male
3328,GEORGE," Umbridge  is  inspecting  McGonagall in your period. That old toad won't know what hit her. Oh,  to  be  a  youth  again,  to experience the innocent glee of watching  Umbridge  be destroyed  by the greatest Head of Gryffindor this century. Well,  we'll  expect  a  full  report after.",5,male
3329,GEORGE, Complete with facial expressions. Greetings my children. I sense even now that many of you have already made the  transition  into  the beyond! Today we will be continuing our interpretation of prophetic dreams. Please divide into your groups and discuss your recent night time visions using the text as a guide. And how long have you been at this post? Near to sixteen years I have been the guide to young seers possessed of the Inner sight. I understand you are the descendent of the famous Seer Cassandra Trelawney? And you are the first  since Cassandra to have the Second Sight? These things tend to skip...several...generations.,5,male
3330,GEORGE, Dumbledore believes he is. You  mean  Dumbledore  believes him.,5,male
3331,GEORGE, We can't go yet. It would look to suspicious if you lot showed up fifteen minutes after Arthur arrives because  Harry's  been  seeing visions of  things happening hundreds of miles from Hogwarts.,5,male
3332,GEORGE," That's our father out there dying! I  can't  let  you  leave.  I'm  sorry. You  don't  even  care!  You  wouldn't even understand! I  was  part  of  the  first  Order.  I lost my best friends to You-Know- Who. He's  all  I  have  left  of  them. Believe  me,  I don't  want  Arthur  to die. But  there  are  some  things  worth dying for! Mum! Your  father's  alive.  He's  going  to make it.",5,male
3333,GEORGE, Might be able to. Just give us a few seconds.,5,male
3334,GEORGE," And now, we've got to go!",5,male
3335,GEORGE," You  know,  I  don't  think  we  are. George,  I  think  we've  outgrown  full- time education.  Wouldn't  you  agree?",5,male
3336,GEORGE," Completely, Fred. Time to enter the real world?",5,male
3337,GEORGE, Definitely. Accio brooms! We won't be seeing you.,5,male
3338,GEORGE," Yeah,  don't  bother  writing. Be sure to visit us at our new premises  on  Diagon Alley!",5,male
3358,SNAPE," Run along, Wormtail.",6,male
3359,SNAPE," If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak. Put it down, Bella.  We mustn’t touch what isn’t ours.",6,male
3360,SNAPE," As it so happens I’m aware of your situation, Narcissa.",6,male
3361,SNAPE," Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable.",6,male
3362,SNAPE, Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it.,6,male
3363,SNAPE, I can’t change the Dark Lord’s mind.  But it might be possible for me to help Draco.  To provide some... protection.,6,male
3364,SNAPE, I can try.,6,male
3365,SNAPE, Take out your wand.,6,male
3366,SNAPE, I will.,6,male
3367,SNAPE, I will.,6,male
3368,SNAPE, I will.,6,male
3369,SNAPE, It was his father’s.,6,male
3370,SNAPE," It’s alright, Mr. Filch.  I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.",6,male
3371,SNAPE, Is this it?,6,male
3372,SNAPE, I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.,6,male
3373,SNAPE, Indeed.  Your evidence?,6,male
3374,SNAPE," You... just... know.  Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing.  How grand it must be to be the Chosen One.",6,male
3375,SNAPE, What’s going on back here?,6,male
3376,SNAPE," You’ve just bought yourself a month’s detention, McLaggen.",6,male
3377,SNAPE," Not so quick, Potter.",6,male
3378,SNAPE, ... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.,6,male
3379,SNAPE," From Professor Dumbledore.  He asked that I give you his best and that he hopes you enjoy your holiday.  You see, he’s traveling and won’t return until term resumes.",6,male
3380,SNAPE, I’ll escort him out.,6,male
3381,SNAPE, I swore to protect you.  I made the Unbreakable Vow --,6,male
3382,SNAPE," You’re afraid, Draco.  You attempt to conceal it, but it’s obvious. Let me assist you --",6,male
3383,SNAPE, Have you ever considered that you ask too much?  That you take too much for granted?  Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don’t want to do this anymore?,6,male
3384,SNAPE, I gave my word.  I made a vow...,6,male
3385,SNAPE, Avada Kedavra!,6,male
3386,SNAPE, You can no longer stay here.,6,male
3387,SNAPE, Go on!,6,male
3388,SNAPE, Go on!,6,male
3389,SNAPE, Don’t ever associate that word and my name again.,6,male
3390,SNAPE, No!  He belongs to the Dark Lord!,6,male
3391,SNAPE," You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?",6,male
3392,SNAPE," You may have gotten your mother’s eyes, but you’re as dim as your father.  Yes.  It’s me.  I’m the Half-Blood Prince.",6,male
3393,HARRY, Oh.  Um.  No one.  Bit of a tosser.,6,male
3394,HARRY, Really.,6,male
3395,HARRY, Hey.  I was wondering...,6,male
3396,HARRY, I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things.,6,male
3397,HARRY," I just Apparated, didn’t I?",6,male
3398,HARRY, Can’t imagine why...,6,male
3399,HARRY," After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir.",6,male
3400,HARRY," My mother’s eyes, yeah.",6,male
3401,HARRY, One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She’s the best in our year.,6,male
3402,HARRY," Sir, exactly what was that all --",6,male
3403,HARRY," It’s alright, sir.  I’ll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --",6,male
3404,HARRY," But, sir.  What about Hedwig?  And there’s my trunk --",6,male
3405,HARRY, Sir?,6,male
3406,HARRY, Didn’t know. Dumbledore.,6,male
3407,HARRY, When’d you get here?,6,male
3408,HARRY, Oh come on...,6,male
3409,HARRY, But we’re talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore.  What could be safer?,6,male
3410,HARRY, Rubbish.  He’s only -- what?,6,male
3411,HARRY, Amazing.,6,male
3412,HARRY, Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?,6,male
3413,HARRY, Reckon he’s right...,6,male
3414,HARRY, Good.  Bad.  Speaking of which...,6,male
3415,HARRY, Dunno.  Let’s get closer.,6,male
3416,HARRY, I don’t know.  I’m turned around.,6,male
3417,HARRY, What just happened?,6,male
3418,HARRY," Don’t you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation.",6,male
3419,HARRY, It’s happened.  He’s one of them.,6,male
3420,HARRY, So what’s he doing in Borgin and Burke’s?  Browsing for furniture?,6,male
3421,HARRY," Look.  His father’s a Death Eater. It only makes sense.  Besides, Hermione saw it.  With her own eyes.",6,male
3422,HARRY, I need some air.,6,male
3423,HARRY, Luna.  How’d you...?,6,male
3424,HARRY," Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna.",6,male
3425,HARRY," I am your friend, Luna.",6,male
3426,HARRY," Professor Flitwick, you’ve known me for five years.",6,male
3427,HARRY, Have you ever fixed one?  A nose.,6,male
3428,HARRY, What the hell.  Give it a go.,6,male
3429,HARRY, Well?  How do I look?,6,male
3430,HARRY, Brilliant.,6,male
3431,HARRY, Later.  What’ve I missed?,6,male
3432,HARRY, Thanks...,6,male
3433,HARRY, This can’t be good.,6,male
3434,HARRY," Well, you see, I’ve got an open period this morning, Professor --",6,male
3435,HARRY, It is.  Or was.  But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L. --,6,male
3436,HARRY, Really?  Well... brilliant.  I’ll head there straight away.,6,male
3437,HARRY," Um, sorry, sir, but I haven’t got my book yet -- nor’s Ron.  You see -- (until this morning...)",6,male
3438,HARRY, Crush it.  Don’t cut it.,6,male
3439,HARRY, No.  Really --,6,male
3440,HARRY," Fine, sir.",6,male
3441,HARRY," I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.",6,male
3442,HARRY, Definitely.,6,male
3443,HARRY, Sir?,6,male
3444,HARRY, No!  I mean... she’s brilliant. And we’re friends.  But... no.,6,male
3445,HARRY," Did you know, sir?  Then?",6,male
3446,HARRY," You didn’t bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach Potions, did you, sir?",6,male
3447,HARRY, You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.,6,male
3448,HARRY, Do you want me to let him?,6,male
3449,HARRY, All right!  Queue up!  Excuse me...,6,male
3450,HARRY, Thanks.  All right.  This morning I’ll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths.  But know this:  Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year.  Is that clear?,6,male
3451,HARRY," All right.  Cormac.  Ron.  It’s down to you two for Keeper.  We’ll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you’ll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac.  Ginny, you’ll take on Ron.",6,male
3452,HARRY, Quiet!  I’m Captain.  We do it my way.  Now line up.  On three. One.  Two... Three!,6,male
3453,HARRY," C’mon, Ron...",6,male
3454,HARRY, Ever heard of this spell?,6,male
3455,HARRY, No.,6,male
3456,HARRY, It’s... old.  The binding is fragile.,6,male
3457,HARRY," I didn’t say I wasn’t curious. And, by the way, I don’t sleep with it.",6,male
3458,HARRY, And?,6,male
3459,HARRY, Good.  That settles it then.,6,male
3460,HARRY, Who’s up for a Butterbeer?,6,male
3461,HARRY, No.  Over here.,6,male
3462,HARRY," No, no.  Sit next to me.",6,male
3463,HARRY," Hello, sir.  Wonderful to see you.",6,male
3464,HARRY," So what brings you here, sir?",6,male
3465,HARRY," I’d consider it an honor, sir.",6,male
3466,HARRY, Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.,6,male
3467,HARRY, Dunno.  But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask.,6,male
3468,HARRY, There’s no time!,6,male
3469,HARRY," She was cursed, wasn’t she?  I know Katie.  Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn’t hurt a fly.  If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn’t doing it knowingly.",6,male
3470,HARRY, It was Malfoy.,6,male
3471,HARRY, I... just... know.,6,male
3472,HARRY, What does she see in him?,6,male
3473,HARRY, You called him a slick git not five hours ago.,6,male
3474,HARRY, I suppose.,6,male
3475,HARRY, I don’t know.  She’s smart. Funny.  Attractive...,6,male
3476,HARRY, You know.  She’s... got nice skin.,6,male
3477,HARRY," Well, no.  I mean... I’m just saying it could be a contributing factor.",6,male
3478,HARRY," I’ve never really thought about it.  But I suppose, yeah.  Very nice.",6,male
3479,HARRY, I think I’ll be going to sleep now.,6,male
3480,HARRY, What?,6,male
3481,HARRY," Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass.",6,male
3482,HARRY, I think I’ll be going.,6,male
3483,HARRY," The shelf, sir?",6,male
3484,HARRY," I don’t really know how to answer that, sir.",6,male
3485,HARRY," Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?",6,male
3486,HARRY," You knew him, didn’t you, sir? Tom Riddle.  You were his teacher.",6,male
3487,HARRY, What was he like?,6,male
3488,HARRY," I’m sorry, sir.  Forgive me.  He killed my parents, you see...",6,male
3489,HARRY, Have it your way.  Juice?,6,male
3490,HARRY, Dunno what you’re talking about.,6,male
3491,HARRY, Yep.  Apparently it’s his lucky day.,6,male
3492,HARRY," Yeah.  I suppose I could’ve just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?",6,male
3493,HARRY, Ah.  Well... they’re really good.,6,male
3494,HARRY, It feels like this.,6,male
3495,HARRY, Have you?,6,male
3496,HARRY," I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we’d really like... maybe we’d go together.  As friends.",6,male
3497,HARRY, So who are you taking?,6,male
3498,HARRY, Really...?,6,male
3499,HARRY, But I am the Chosen One.,6,male
3500,HARRY, Okay.  Kidding.  I’ll just ask someone I like.  Someone cool.,6,male
3501,HARRY, Neville...?,6,male
3502,HARRY, And what’s happened to you?,6,male
3503,HARRY, Cormac!  That’s who you invited!,6,male
3504,HARRY, I think she went to powder her nose.,6,male
3505,HARRY, Dragon balls.,6,male
3506,HARRY," I think I should rejoin the party, sir.  My date...",6,male
3507,HARRY, A message...?,6,male
3508,HARRY, Traveling?  Where?,6,male
3509,HARRY, Positive.  Why?,6,male
3510,HARRY," I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.",6,male
3511,HARRY, Lovely.,6,male
3512,HARRY, I’ll take your word for it.,6,male
3513,HARRY, So what happens?  If you break an Unbreakable Vow?,6,male
3514,HARRY," Draco’s plotting something, I know it, something to do with Voldemort.  He’s been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help.",6,male
3515,HARRY, I know it sounds mad --,6,male
3516,HARRY, That’s not what it sounded like.,6,male
3517,HARRY, But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He’s said it himself --,6,male
3518,HARRY, I’m not --,6,male
3519,HARRY, It’s good.,6,male
3520,HARRY," Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?",6,male
3521,HARRY, Did you get my owl?,6,male
3522,HARRY, Go on.,6,male
3523,HARRY, A Vanishing Cabinet?,6,male
3524,HARRY, What happened to it?  The one at Borgin & Burkes?,6,male
3525,HARRY, Soon.,6,male
3526,HARRY," I know who I am, Hermione, alright? Sorry.",6,male
3527,HARRY," If Dumbledore’s traveling places, it’s news to the Ministry.  But get this:  that night at Borgin & Burkes?  It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.",6,male
3528,HARRY, You tell me.,6,male
3529,HARRY, Who could tell the difference?,6,male
3530,HARRY, I don’t understand -- what happened?,6,male
3531,HARRY, But why would he tamper with his own memory?,6,male
3532,HARRY, Why?,6,male
3533,HARRY," I don’t know him that well, sir --",6,male
3534,HARRY," Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.",6,male
3535,HARRY," Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.  Something about a bit of rare magic...",6,male
3536,HARRY," I’m not sure... That is, I don’t recall the name... exactly.  But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you’re not allowed to teach?",6,male
3537,HARRY," Yes, well, we don’t exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.  What I mean to say is, he’s not like you.  He might... misunderstand.",6,male
3538,HARRY," Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir?  When he came asking questions.",6,male
3539,HARRY, Sir --,6,male
3540,HARRY, Nice.,6,male
3541,HARRY, Hermione.  I think Malfoy’s leaving the castle.,6,male
3542,HARRY, I’ve seen it.  Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map.,6,male
3543,HARRY, The Map is never wrong.,6,male
3544,HARRY," Divine.  Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?",6,male
3545,HARRY, Or twenty.,6,male
3546,HARRY," Really?  Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you.",6,male
3547,HARRY, Excuse me?,6,male
3548,HARRY, Well... Brilliant.,6,male
3549,HARRY, Bloody well hope so.  She’s been snogging you for three months.,6,male
3550,HARRY, Who’re you talking about?,6,male
3551,HARRY, Okay.  Very funny.,6,male
3552,HARRY, What the hell was that for?,6,male
3553,HARRY, Okay!  Fine!  You’re in love with her!  Have you ever actually met her!,6,male
3554,HARRY," Ron, these chocolates, they’re -- C’mon.  I’m going to introduce you to Romilda Vane.",6,male
3555,HARRY, Devastatingly handsome.,6,male
3556,HARRY, Sir.  I’m sorry.  I wouldn’t bother you if it weren’t absolutely --,6,male
3557,HARRY," I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir.",6,male
3558,HARRY," I’m sorry, sir.  About the other day.  Our... misunderstanding.",6,male
3559,HARRY," I mean, I’m sure you’re tired of it, after all these years.  The questions.  About... Voldemort.",6,male
3560,HARRY," Yes, sir.  It’s just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.  It seemed sensible.",6,male
3561,HARRY, Love potion.,6,male
3562,HARRY," Ron!  Ron!!!  Professor, help him!",6,male
3563,HARRY, Professor!  Do something!!,6,male
3564,HARRY, He’s choking!!,6,male
3565,HARRY," Breathe!  C’mon, Ron, don’t be a prat.  Breathe!  BREATHE!",6,male
3566,HARRY," How are you, Katie?",6,male
3567,HARRY, SECTUMSEMPRA!,6,male
3568,HARRY, The Room of Requirement...,6,male
3569,HARRY, Who showed you this?  First.,6,male
3570,HARRY, What?,6,male
3571,HARRY, Oh.  Yeah.,6,male
3572,HARRY, Say that again.,6,male
3573,HARRY, Excellent.  Really excellent.,6,male
3574,HARRY, Right.  I’m going down to Hagrid’s.,6,male
3575,HARRY," No.  I’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid’s.  I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, know what I mean?",6,male
3576,HARRY, Trust me.  I know what I’m doing. Or at least Felix does.,6,male
3577,HARRY," Sorry, sir.  I should’ve announced myself.  Cleared my throat. Coughed.  You probably feared I was Madam Sprout.",6,male
3578,HARRY," Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around.  The jumping when you saw me.  By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they’re quite valuable, aren’t they?",6,male
3579,HARRY," Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out.",6,male
3580,HARRY," Through the front doors, sir.  I’m off to Hagrid’s, you see.  He’s a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit.  So if you don’t mind, I’ll be going.",6,male
3581,HARRY, Sir?,6,male
3582,HARRY," Well, then by all means come along, sir.",6,male
3583,HARRY," That would be counterproductive, sir.",6,male
3584,HARRY, No idea.,6,male
3585,HARRY," A dead one, I think, sir.",6,male
3586,HARRY, Not to mention the pincers.,6,male
3587,HARRY, Through the front doors.,6,male
3588,HARRY, Oh yeah.,6,male
3589,HARRY, Poof.,6,male
3590,HARRY, Do you know why I survived?  The night I got this.,6,male
3591,HARRY, Because of her.  Because she sacrificed herself.  Because she refused to step aside.  Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.,6,male
3592,HARRY," I’m not afraid of the name, Professor.  And I’m not afraid of him.  And you shouldn’t be either. She didn’t just die for me that night.  She died for you too.  She died for everyone who’s ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep.",6,male
3593,HARRY," Professor.  I’m going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at.  It’s true.  I am the Chosen One.",6,male
3594,HARRY," Only I can kill him.  But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him.",6,male
3595,HARRY," Be brave, Professor.  Be brave like my mother.  Otherwise you disgrace her.  Otherwise she died for nothing.  Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever.",6,male
3596,HARRY, Sir --,6,male
3597,HARRY," Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir?  In making a Horcrux?",6,male
3598,HARRY, Seven.  He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.  But... what are they exactly?,6,male
3599,HARRY, Tom Riddle’s diary --,6,male
3600,HARRY, And the ring...?,6,male
3601,HARRY, But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux...,6,male
3602,HARRY," But how would you find them?  They could be hidden anywhere, couldn’t they...",6,male
3603,HARRY," It’s where you’ve been going, isn’t it, sir?  When you leave the school.",6,male
3604,HARRY," Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?",6,male
3605,HARRY, It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map.,6,male
3606,HARRY, He was going to the Room of Requirement.,6,male
3607,HARRY, But I’m telling you.  I saw it --,6,male
3608,HARRY, What if there are two?  Vanishing cabinets.,6,male
3609,HARRY, I don’t know...,6,male
3610,HARRY, I don’t need luck.  I’ll be with Dumbledore.,6,male
3611,HARRY," You look the same to me, sir.",6,male
3612,HARRY," Yes, sir.",6,male
3613,HARRY, My word.,6,male
3614,HARRY," Sir, I thought one couldn’t Apparate within Hogwarts.",6,male
3615,HARRY," It’s there, isn’t it?",6,male
3616,HARRY, Sir!,6,male
3617,HARRY," You should’ve let me, sir.",6,male
3618,HARRY," We couldn’t, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?",6,male
3619,HARRY, Accio Horcrux!,6,male
3620,HARRY, Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?,6,male
3621,HARRY, Professor... there are bodies in this lake.,6,male
3622,HARRY," Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?",6,male
3623,HARRY," Why can’t I drink it, sir?",6,male
3624,HARRY, Professor?,6,male
3625,HARRY, Professor?  Can you hear me?,6,male
3626,HARRY," You... you can’t stop, Professor. You’ve got to keep drinking.  Like you said.  Remember.",6,male
3627,HARRY," It will, sir.  It’ll stop.  But only if you drink...",6,male
3628,HARRY, What?,6,male
3629,HARRY, No...,6,male
3630,HARRY, One more.  Just one more.  And then -- I promise... I’ll do what you say.,6,male
3631,HARRY, I promise.,6,male
3632,HARRY, Aguamenti.,6,male
3633,HARRY," You did it, sir.  Look --",6,male
3634,HARRY," I’m trying, sir.  I’m --",6,male
3635,HARRY," Don’t worry, sir.  We’re nearly there.",6,male
3636,HARRY," We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey --",6,male
3637,HARRY, All right.  Okay.,6,male
3638,HARRY," Sir, are you... praying?",6,male
3639,HARRY, Cruciatus!,6,male
3640,HARRY, Incacerata!,6,male
3641,HARRY, Impedimenta!,6,male
3642,HARRY," Fight!  Fight back, you coward!",6,male
3643,HARRY, Sectumsempra!,6,male
3644,HARRY, Hagrid... HAGRID!,6,male
3645,HARRY, Hagrid!  You alright?,6,male
3646,HARRY," Hagrid, Dumbledore --",6,male
3647,HARRY," No.  He was lowering his wand.  In the end, it was Snape.  It was always Snape.  And I did nothing...",6,male
3648,HARRY," Yeah, strange.  Only... it’s not. It’s a fake.",6,male
3649,HARRY, Go on.  Open it.,6,male
3650,HARRY," Dunno.  But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux.  Which means, it was a waste.  All of it.",6,male
3651,HARRY," I’m not coming back, Hermione.",6,male
3652,HARRY, I have to finish what Dumbledore started.  I’m not sure where that will lead me... but I’ll let you and Ron konw where I am -- when I can. Dumbledore started.  And... I have to do it alone.),6,male
3653,HARRY, Yeah.  I do.  But do me a favor. When I’m around?  Keep the snogging to a minimum.,6,male
3654,HARRY," Funny, he says the same about you.",6,male
3655,HARRY, You’re brilliant.  You both are.,6,male
3656,HARRY, I don’t know.,6,male
3657,DUMBLEDORE," I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk.  No light could resist it... You’ve been reckless this summer, Harry.",6,male
3658,DUMBLEDORE," Rather unpleasant to behold, isn’t it?  The tale is thrilling if I do say so myself, but I’m afraid now is not the time to tell it.  Take my arm. Do as I say.",6,male
3659,DUMBLEDORE, Indeed.  And quite successfully I might add.  Most people vomit their first time.,6,male
3660,DUMBLEDORE," Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry.  I assume right about now you’re wondering why I’ve brought you here, am I right?",6,male
3661,DUMBLEDORE," Wand out, Harry.",6,male
3662,DUMBLEDORE, Lumos...,6,male
3663,DUMBLEDORE, Horace!,6,male
3664,DUMBLEDORE," I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace.",6,male
3665,DUMBLEDORE, Dragon’s blood.,6,male
3666,DUMBLEDORE," Ah yes.  Introductions.  Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.  Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. Apparently there’s some thought he may be the Chosen One.",6,male
3667,DUMBLEDORE," So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren’t perhaps expecting someone else, were you?",6,male
3668,DUMBLEDORE, Take matters into their own hands?,6,male
3669,DUMBLEDORE," Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don’t you? Mind?",6,male
3670,DUMBLEDORE, That was fun.  May I use the loo?,6,male
3671,DUMBLEDORE, Mind if I take this?  I do love knitting patterns.,6,male
3672,DUMBLEDORE," I think I know a lost cause when I see one.  Regrettable.  I would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace.  You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind.",6,male
3673,DUMBLEDORE, Indeed they are.,6,male
3674,DUMBLEDORE," You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace values.  Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry.  You would be his crowning jewel.  That is why he is returning to Hogwarts.  And it is crucial he return...",6,male
3675,DUMBLEDORE," I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl.",6,male
3676,DUMBLEDORE," You’ll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.",6,male
3677,DUMBLEDORE, Both are waiting for you.,6,male
3678,DUMBLEDORE," The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn.",6,male
3679,DUMBLEDORE," Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master.  Meanwhile the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts will be assumed by Professor Snape.",6,male
3680,DUMBLEDORE," Now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight.  You have a right to know why.",6,male
3681,DUMBLEDORE," Today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  Which is why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.  Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.  But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you.",6,male
3682,DUMBLEDORE," Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed.  Pip pip!",6,male
3683,DUMBLEDORE," Good evening, Harry.  You got my message, I see.  Come, come.  Sit.",6,male
3684,DUMBLEDORE, So.  How are you?,6,male
3685,DUMBLEDORE," Enjoying your classes?  Professor Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you.",6,male
3686,DUMBLEDORE, Do you?,6,male
3687,DUMBLEDORE, And what of your activities outside the classroom?  Do they bring you satisfaction?,6,male
3688,DUMBLEDORE, I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.  One can’t help but wonder if --,6,male
3689,DUMBLEDORE," Forgive me, Harry, I...",6,male
3690,DUMBLEDORE," ... I was merely curious. In any event, I’m sure you’re wondering why I’ve summoned you here tonight.  The answer lies here.",6,male
3691,DUMBLEDORE, What you see before you are memories.  In this case pertaining to one individual:  Voldemort.  Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle.,6,male
3692,DUMBLEDORE, This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first met him.  I’d like you to see it.  If you would...,6,male
3693,DUMBLEDORE, I am not family.  But his name has been known to me since birth.,6,male
3694,DUMBLEDORE, Perhaps you could give me an example.,6,male
3695,DUMBLEDORE," How do you do, Tom.",6,male
3696,DUMBLEDORE, As you wish.,6,male
3697,DUMBLEDORE, No.  I am a Professor.,6,male
3698,DUMBLEDORE, Perhaps they’re right.,6,male
3699,DUMBLEDORE, Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.,6,male
3700,DUMBLEDORE, It’s a school.  A school of... magic.,6,male
3701,DUMBLEDORE," You can do things, can’t you, Tom? Things the other children can’t.",6,male
3702,DUMBLEDORE," Tell me some of the things you can do, Tom.",6,male
3703,DUMBLEDORE," I’m like you, Tom.  Different.",6,male
3704,DUMBLEDORE," I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom. Open it.  Open.  It.",6,male
3705,DUMBLEDORE, Take it out.,6,male
3706,DUMBLEDORE, Is there anything in that box you ought not to have?,6,male
3707,DUMBLEDORE," Why did you want these things, Tom?",6,male
3708,DUMBLEDORE," Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts.  At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? I’ll be going now, Tom.  Leave your window open tonight.  An owl will bring you a message.  Read it carefully.",6,male
3709,DUMBLEDORE, It is unusual.  But not unheard of.,6,male
3710,DUMBLEDORE, Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time?  No.  Had I...,6,male
3711,DUMBLEDORE," Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher.  Can you guess which teacher that might be?",6,male
3712,DUMBLEDORE," No.  I did not.  You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... I’d rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry.  But I promise. In time you will know everything.",6,male
3713,DUMBLEDORE, I did.,6,male
3714,DUMBLEDORE, Yes.,6,male
3715,DUMBLEDORE, Confused?  I would be surprised if you weren’t.,6,male
3716,DUMBLEDORE," This is perhaps the most important memory I’ve collected.  It’s also a lie. This memory has been tampered with.  In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn.",6,male
3717,DUMBLEDORE, I suspect he is ashamed of it.,6,male
3718,DUMBLEDORE, Why indeed.,6,male
3719,DUMBLEDORE, I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you’ve done so.,6,male
3720,DUMBLEDORE," You’re the Chosen One, Harry.  And Horace is, at heart, a decent man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins.",6,male
3721,DUMBLEDORE," This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind.  Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.  You have no choice. You must not fail.",6,male
3722,DUMBLEDORE," Quick thinking on your part, Harry.  Using a Bezoar.  You must be very proud of your student, eh, Horace?",6,male
3723,DUMBLEDORE, Why indeed.,6,male
3724,DUMBLEDORE," This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don’t by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison.",6,male
3725,DUMBLEDORE, To whom might I ask?,6,male
3726,DUMBLEDORE," Ah, to be young and feel love’s keen sting.  Come, everyone, I think Mr. Weasley is well tended.",6,male
3727,DUMBLEDORE, How is he?  Horace?,6,male
3728,DUMBLEDORE, This is beyond anything I imagined.  In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.  I know now... you will see worse.,6,male
3729,DUMBLEDORE," Oh he succeeded.  And not just once.  Think, Harry.  He’s just told us.",6,male
3730,DUMBLEDORE," They can be anything.  The most commonplace of objects.  A ring, for example.  Or a book...",6,male
3731,DUMBLEDORE," It’s a Horcrux, yes.  Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley’s life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this -- I knew.  This was a different kind of magic.  Very dark.  Very powerful.  But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful...",6,male
3732,DUMBLEDORE, Belonged to Voldemort’s mother. It was difficult to find and... ... even more difficult to destroy.,6,male
3733,DUMBLEDORE, One destroys Voldemort.,6,male
3734,DUMBLEDORE," True.  But magic, especially Dark magic...",6,male
3735,DUMBLEDORE, ... leaves traces.,6,male
3736,DUMBLEDORE, Yes.  And I think... perhaps... I may have found another.  But this time I cannot hope to destroy it alone.,6,male
3737,DUMBLEDORE," Once again, I shall ask too much of you.",6,male
3738,DUMBLEDORE," Whether it has or hasn’t is irrelevant.  I will not negotiate this with you, Severus.  You agreed.  There’s nothing more to discuss.",6,male
3739,DUMBLEDORE," Harry.  You need a shave, my friend.",6,male
3740,DUMBLEDORE," At times I forget how much you’ve grown.  At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard. Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.  I am an old man.",6,male
3741,DUMBLEDORE," Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind.",6,male
3742,DUMBLEDORE," The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, Harry.  I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise.  But there is a condition:  You must obey any command I give you -- without question.",6,male
3743,DUMBLEDORE," Understand what I’m saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must hide.",6,male
3744,DUMBLEDORE," Should I tell you to run, you will run.",6,male
3745,DUMBLEDORE, And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself...,6,male
3746,DUMBLEDORE, You will do so.,6,male
3747,DUMBLEDORE," Your word, Harry.",6,male
3748,DUMBLEDORE, Take my arm.,6,male
3749,DUMBLEDORE, Being me has its privileges.,6,male
3750,DUMBLEDORE," This is the place.  Oh yes, this place has known magic. Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty...",6,male
3751,DUMBLEDORE," One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. What happened is unclear.  But this much is known:  the children were damaged.",6,male
3752,DUMBLEDORE," In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder.",6,male
3753,DUMBLEDORE," Oh, no, Harry.  Your blood is much more precious than mine.",6,male
3754,DUMBLEDORE, Careful.  The water.,6,male
3755,DUMBLEDORE, It’s there.  The only question is how do we get to it?,6,male
3756,DUMBLEDORE, Perhaps not.,6,male
3757,DUMBLEDORE," If you would, Harry...",6,male
3758,DUMBLEDORE," Only recreationally.  You see, I believe one creates one’s own luck.",6,male
3759,DUMBLEDORE, Yes.,6,male
3760,DUMBLEDORE, Remember... the water.,6,male
3761,DUMBLEDORE, Oh yes.,6,male
3762,DUMBLEDORE, It has to be drunk. You remember the condition on which I brought you with me?,6,male
3763,DUMBLEDORE," This potion might paralyze me.  It might cause me to forget why I’m here.  It might create so much pain I beg for relief.  You are not to indulge these requests, Harry.  It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.  Understood?",6,male
3764,DUMBLEDORE," Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. Your good health, Harry.",6,male
3765,DUMBLEDORE, Don’t... don’t make me...,6,male
3766,DUMBLEDORE, Nooooooo!!!,6,male
3767,DUMBLEDORE, Make it stop... Please... make it stop...,6,male
3768,DUMBLEDORE, My fault.  It’s all my fault...,6,male
3769,DUMBLEDORE," Too much... I can’t... take it... I want... to die... kill... kill me... KILL ME, HARRY!",6,male
3770,DUMBLEDORE," Your word, Harry!  Your word!",6,male
3771,DUMBLEDORE, KILL ME!  IT’S THE ONLY WAY!,6,male
3772,DUMBLEDORE, Water.,6,male
3773,DUMBLEDORE, Water...,6,male
3774,DUMBLEDORE, Water!,6,male
3775,DUMBLEDORE, Go...,6,male
3776,DUMBLEDORE, We have to... go.,6,male
3777,DUMBLEDORE," I am not worried, Harry.  I am with you.",6,male
3778,DUMBLEDORE, No.  Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell him what has happened...,6,male
3779,DUMBLEDORE," No, Harry.  I do not pray.  I was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate.",6,male
3780,DUMBLEDORE, Hide yourself below.  And do not speak or show yourself without my permission.  No matter what.,6,male
3781,DUMBLEDORE," Do as I say, Harry.",6,male
3782,DUMBLEDORE, Trust me.,6,male
3783,DUMBLEDORE," Good evening, Draco.  What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening?  Or is it Summer?",6,male
3784,DUMBLEDORE," I often talk aloud to myself.  I find it extraordinarily useful. That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. Haven’t been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco?",6,male
3785,DUMBLEDORE," You are not an assassin, Draco.",6,male
3786,DUMBLEDORE," Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. I’m curious.  When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper?",6,male
3787,DUMBLEDORE, Then I shall make it easy for you.,6,male
3788,DUMBLEDORE," Well done, Draco.  But I warn you. Killing is not nearly as easy.",6,male
3789,DUMBLEDORE, You’re not alone.  Are you.  There are others.  How?,6,male
3790,DUMBLEDORE, That cabinet has been broken for years.,6,male
3791,DUMBLEDORE, Ingenious.  Let me guess.  It has a sister.  A twin.,6,male
3792,DUMBLEDORE," A passage, yes.  Very good. I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.  Let me help you, Draco.",6,male
3793,DUMBLEDORE," Say that again, Draco.  But aloud this time.",6,male
3794,DUMBLEDORE," Good evening, Bellatrix.  I think introductions are in order.",6,male
3795,DUMBLEDORE, Severus...,6,male
3796,DUMBLEDORE, Severus... please.,6,male
3797,SLUGHORN," There’s no need to disfigure me, Albus!",6,male
3798,SLUGHORN, It’s all in the upholstery. I come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away?,6,male
3799,SLUGHORN," Yes, well, I couldn’t very well use wizard’s blood, could I?  Oho!",6,male
3800,SLUGHORN, S-someone else?  I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.,6,male
3801,SLUGHORN, Oh all right!  The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.  Do you know what that’s like?  One can only say no to these people so many times before they...,6,male
3802,SLUGHORN, I never stay anywhere more than a week.  The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands.,6,male
3803,SLUGHORN," Don’t think I don’t know why you’re here, Albus!  The answer is still no!  Absolutely, unequivocally no!",6,male
3804,SLUGHORN, You look very like your father. Except for your eyes.  You’ve got --,6,male
3805,SLUGHORN, Lily.  Lovely Lily.  She was exceedingly bright -- your mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born.,6,male
3806,SLUGHORN," Oh, but you mustn’t think I’m prejudiced!  No, no, no!  Your mother was one of my absolute favorites!  Look, there she is. Right up front.",6,male
3807,SLUGHORN," All mine, each and every one.  Ex- students, I mean.  You recognize Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor of the Daily Prophet.",6,male
3808,SLUGHORN," Ah yes.  Regulus Black.  You no doubt know of his older brother Sirius.  Died a few weeks ago.  I taught the whole Black family except Sirius.  Shame.  Talented boy.  I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I’d have liked the set.",6,male
3809,SLUGHORN, Of course.  But you’re not leaving?,6,male
3810,SLUGHORN," All right!  I’ll do it.  But I’ll be wanting Professor Merrythought’s old office, not that water closet I had formerly. And I expect a raise!  These are mad times we live in!  Mad!",6,male
3811,SLUGHORN, Harry m’boy!  I was beginning to worry!  And I see we’ve brought someone with us...,6,male
3812,SLUGHORN," Nonsense, we’ll sort you out.  Any friend of Harry’s is a friend of mine.  Right then, books out --",6,male
3813,SLUGHORN, Not to worry.  You can get what you need from the cupboard.,6,male
3814,SLUGHORN," Now, as I was saying, I’ve prepared a few concoctions this morning.  Any ideas what these might be?  Yes, Miss...?",6,male
3815,SLUGHORN, One of my best friends is Muggle- born.  She’s the best in our year...,6,male
3816,SLUGHORN," Now Amortentia doesn’t create actual love, of course.  That’s impossible.  But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room.",6,male
3817,SLUGHORN, Ah yes...,6,male
3818,SLUGHORN," What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as --",6,male
3819,SLUGHORN," Yes, Miss Granger.  Desperately tricky to make.  Disastrous should you get it wrong.  But brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers.  One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the effects wear off.",6,male
3820,SLUGHORN," Because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence.",6,male
3821,SLUGHORN, Twice.  Once when I was twenty- four.  Once when I was fifty- seven.  Two tablespoons taken at breakfast.  Two perfect days...,6,male
3822,SLUGHORN," So.  This is what I offer each of you today.  One tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook.",6,male
3823,SLUGHORN," You should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.  In any event -- good luck.",6,male
3824,SLUGHORN," Merlin’s Beard!  But it’s perfect. So perfect I daresay one sip would kill us all!  Your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this... My, my, what can’t you do, m’boy? Perhaps you will save us all in the end...",6,male
3825,SLUGHORN," Here you are then, as promised. One bottle of Felix Felicis.  Use it well.",6,male
3826,SLUGHORN, Filius!  I was hoping to find you at the Three Broomsticks.,6,male
3827,SLUGHORN," Harry, m’boy!",6,male
3828,SLUGHORN," Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back.  Longer than I’d care to admit.  In fact, I remember when it was simply One Broomstick!",6,male
3829,SLUGHORN," Oops!  All hands on deck, Granger!",6,male
3830,SLUGHORN," Listen, m’boy.  In the old days, I used to throw together the occasional supper and invite a select student or two.  Would you be game?",6,male
3831,SLUGHORN," You’d be welcome too, Granger.",6,male
3832,SLUGHORN," Brilliant.  Look for my owl. Good to see you, Wallenby.",6,male
3833,SLUGHORN, To Hogwarts’ best and brightest!,6,male
3834,SLUGHORN," So tell me, Cormac.  See much of your Uncle Tiberius these days?",6,male
3835,SLUGHORN," Well, be sure to give them both my best.  What about your uncle, Belby?  Working on anything new? For those of you who don’t know, Marcus’ uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.",6,male
3836,SLUGHORN," And you, Miss Granger?  What is it your family does in the Muggle world?",6,male
3837,SLUGHORN, Fascinating.  And is that considered a dangerous profession?,6,male
3838,SLUGHORN," Miss Weasley!  Come in, come in.",6,male
3839,SLUGHORN, No matter.  You’ll be just in time for dessert.  That is -- if Belby leaves you any.,6,male
3840,SLUGHORN," Thank you, one and all, for a most stimulating evening.  We’ll have to do it again.",6,male
3841,SLUGHORN, Oh.  Potter.,6,male
3842,SLUGHORN," Ah, yes.  A most intriguing object.  The sands run in accordance to the quality of the conversation.  When it is stimulating, the sands run slow. When it is not...",6,male
3843,SLUGHORN," Nonsense.  You have nothing to fear, m’boy.  As for some of your classmates, well, let’s just say, they’re unlikely to make the shelf.",6,male
3844,SLUGHORN," Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.  Then again... you are already someone aren’t you, Harry?",6,male
3845,SLUGHORN," Your mother was modest too.  Your father not so much.  As you can see, he did not make the shelf.",6,male
3846,SLUGHORN, Mr. Riddle had many teachers while here at Hogwarts.,6,male
3847,SLUGHORN," Of course.  It’s only natural that you should want to know more.  I’m afraid I must disappoint you, Harry.  When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.  Not unlike the others I’ve known.  In fact, not unlike... you.  If the monster existed, it was buried deep within.",6,male
3848,SLUGHORN," Thank you, Adrian! One of mine.  Class of ‘78.  I had hoped for more out of him, but at least the pictures are in focus. Oh my!  Excuse me, Harry.  I must greet the new Minister of Magical Transportation.  Class of ‘67. Mingle, m’boy!  Mingle!  We’re all friends here.  And we run the world.",6,male
3849,SLUGHORN," Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m’boy, I’d like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you’re quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?",6,male
3850,SLUGHORN," Good gracious, look at the time. Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don’t forget your essays...",6,male
3851,SLUGHORN," Look sharp, Tom.  You don’t want to be caught out of bed after hours...",6,male
3852,SLUGHORN," Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?",6,male
3853,SLUGHORN, Go on.,6,male
3854,SLUGHORN, I don’t know anything about such things and I wouldn’t tell you if I did!  Now get out of here at once and don’t ever let me catch you mentioning it again!,6,male
3855,SLUGHORN," Now don’t forget to look over the chapter on antidotes.  I’ll be poisoning one of you next time we meet.  I’m joking!  Off you go! Don’t forget your rattails, Miss Alys.",6,male
3856,SLUGHORN, Ah! If it isn’t the Prince of Potions himself!  To what do I owe the pleasure?,6,male
3857,SLUGHORN," Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!",6,male
3858,SLUGHORN, Yes?  And exactly what was this rare magic.,6,male
3859,SLUGHORN," I’m a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape.",6,male
3860,SLUGHORN," There can be no light without the dark.  And so it is with magic. Myself, I have always strived to live within the light.  I suggest you do the same.",6,male
3861,SLUGHORN, Dumbledore put you up to this. Didn’t he?  Didn’t he!,6,male
3862,SLUGHORN, Yes???!!!! Oh.  Potter.  It’s you.  I’m afraid I’m busy at the moment --,6,male
3863,SLUGHORN, What’s the matter with Wenby?,6,male
3864,SLUGHORN, Ah.  Very well.  Bring him in.,6,male
3865,SLUGHORN," I’d have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, Harry -- an expert potioneer like you.",6,male
3866,SLUGHORN, Hm.  Perhaps you’re right.,6,male
3867,SLUGHORN," Yes, well, water under the bridge as they say, correct?",6,male
3868,SLUGHORN, I’ll ask you not to use that name.,6,male
3869,SLUGHORN," With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark Lord who ever lived.",6,male
3870,SLUGHORN," Alright, m’boy!  Bottoms up!",6,male
3871,SLUGHORN, A tonic for the nerves.,6,male
3872,SLUGHORN, And a bloody strong one at that.,6,male
3873,SLUGHORN," Pick-me-up’s what you need, m’boy. Do us all good, I think.  I’ve got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a dazzling oak-matured mead.  I had other intentions for this but given the circumstances...",6,male
3874,SLUGHORN," There we are, Potter.  To life!",6,male
3875,SLUGHORN, I d-don’t understand --,6,male
3876,SLUGHORN, Hm?  Oh.  Yes... very proud.,6,male
3877,SLUGHORN, Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.,6,male
3878,SLUGHORN," You, Headmaster.",6,male
3879,SLUGHORN, I’ve always cherished my students. They’re my life...,6,male
3880,SLUGHORN," Merlin’s beard, Harry!",6,male
3881,SLUGHORN," Well, yes, actually -- Why would you think that?",6,male
3882,SLUGHORN," Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I’m familiar with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all.  My own interests are purely academic, of course.",6,male
3883,SLUGHORN," Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry?",6,male
3884,SLUGHORN, Harry!,6,male
3885,SLUGHORN, It’s nearly nightfall.  Surely you realize I can’t allow you to roam the grounds all by yourself.,6,male
3886,SLUGHORN," Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately!",6,male
3887,SLUGHORN, And what makes you say that?,6,male
3888,SLUGHORN, Merlin’s beard...,6,male
3889,SLUGHORN, Is that an actual Acromantula?,6,male
3890,SLUGHORN," My god, dear man.  How did you ever manage to kill it?",6,male
3891,SLUGHORN," I’m sorry, I... (didn’t realize.)",6,male
3892,SLUGHORN," Hagrid.  I wouldn’t want to be indelicate, but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn’t mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits...",6,male
3893,SLUGHORN," My thoughts exactly!  Always carry a few spare ampoules for just such occasions.  Old Potion Master’s habit, you know...",6,male
3894,SLUGHORN, Why don’t I say a few words?  I trust he had family?,6,male
3895,SLUGHORN, Farewell...,6,male
3896,SLUGHORN," Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids.  Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your Forest home.  May your many-eyed descendents ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.",6,male
3897,SLUGHORN, Sweet.  I once had a fish. Francis.  Lovely little thing. One day I came downstairs and he’d vanished.  Poof.,6,male
3898,SLUGHORN," Isn’t it?  That’s life, I suppose. One goes along and then... poof.",6,male
3899,SLUGHORN," That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?",6,male
3900,SLUGHORN," But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s worth?",6,male
3901,SLUGHORN," It was a student who gave me Francis.  One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower petal floating upon the surface.  As I watched, the petal sank, but just before it touched bottom... it transformed. Into a wee fish.  It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold.  The petal had come from a lily.",6,male
3902,SLUGHORN," Your mother.  The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl empty... was the day she...",6,male
3903,SLUGHORN, I know what you want.  But I can’t give it to you.  It will ruin me...,6,male
3904,SLUGHORN, Please don’t say his --,6,male
3905,SLUGHORN, Don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it.  You don’t know what he was like... even then.,6,male
3906,SLUGHORN," Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I knew, could I?  I must say, m’boy, I’d like to know where you get your information.  More knowledgable than half the staff, you are. By the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you’re quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew?",6,male
3907,SLUGHORN," Good gracious, is it that time already?  Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention.  Lestrange, Avery, don’t forget your essays...",6,male
3908,SLUGHORN," Look sharp, Tom.  You don’t want to be caught out of bed after hours...",6,male
3909,SLUGHORN," Yes, I imagine you do.  Something on your mind, Tom?",6,male
3910,SLUGHORN, Go on.,6,male
3911,SLUGHORN, Excuse me?,6,male
3912,SLUGHORN," I’m not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that’s very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed.",6,male
3913,SLUGHORN, A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul.,6,male
3914,SLUGHORN," One splits one’s soul and hides part of it in an object.  By doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed.",6,male
3915,SLUGHORN," That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on.  In other words, you cannot die.",6,male
3916,SLUGHORN," I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom.",6,male
3917,SLUGHORN," Yes.  Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature. After, one is never the same.",6,male
3918,SLUGHORN," Seven!  Merlin’s beard, Tom! Isn’t it bad enough to think of killing one person?  To rip the soul into seven pieces...",6,male
3964,RON, Harry?  Did someone say Harry?,6,male
3965,RON," ‘Course not.  Think I’d know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn’t I?",6,male
3966,RON, You’ve a bit of...,6,male
3967,RON, Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts.  That it’s too dangerous.,6,male
3968,RON," Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy.  Took a day or two, but she came round.",6,male
3969,RON, A hundred and fifty.  Give or take a few years.,6,male
3970,RON, How much for this?,6,male
3971,RON, How much for me?,6,male
3972,RON, But I’m your brother!,6,male
3973,RON, C’mon.  Let’s go.,6,male
3974,RON, Hi.,6,male
3975,RON, Fred reckons people need a laugh these days.,6,male
3976,RON, Is it just me?  Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don’t want to be followed?,6,male
3977,RON, What’re they playing at?,6,male
3978,RON, Hey.  Where’s Hermione?,6,male
3979,RON," Harry, where is she?",6,male
3980,RON, Sorry.,6,male
3981,RON, One of what?,6,male
3982,RON, You’re barking.  What would You- Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy?,6,male
3983,RON, It’s a creepy shop.  He’s a creepy bloke.,6,male
3984,RON, Probably on the platform.  C’mon.,6,male
3985,RON, Don’ you worry.  He’ll be ‘long soon ‘nuff --,6,male
3986,RON," Oi!  Turn around, you lunatic.",6,male
3987,RON, Looks like his own this time.,6,male
3988,RON," Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say -- it’s a hat, isn’t it?  First Years seemed to enjoy it, though. Wankers.  Filch give you the wand outside?",6,male
3989,RON, That was cheerful.,6,male
3990,RON, But I don’t want to take Potions!,6,male
3991,RON," Ron Weasley, sir.  But I’m dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going --",6,male
3992,RON, Hard feelings?,6,male
3993,RON," Really?  Strapping guy like you, you’ve got a Beater’s build, don’t you think?  Keeper needs to be agile, quick --",6,male
3994,RON," Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one.  Hope Cormac’s not taking it too hard.",6,male
3995,RON," Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione.  Cormac.",6,male
3996,RON," Not bloody likely.  He’s top of the class.  Even better than you, Hermione.  Slughorn thinks he’s a genius.",6,male
3997,RON, What?,6,male
3998,RON," Yeah.  Right. Well, it’s true.  I like a nice chat before I go to bed.  Now you’re always reading that bloody book.  It’s like being with Hermione.",6,male
3999,RON, Spider?  About six feet tall?  Ten feet wide?,6,male
4000,RON, Barking.  Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us?  What?,6,male
4001,RON, O-kay.,6,male
4002,RON," Aw, bloody hell...",6,male
4003,RON, I’d like to leave.,6,male
4004,RON, That happens to be my sister.,6,male
4005,RON, What’re you playing at?,6,male
4006,RON, Get to know him?,6,male
4007,RON, Um... You’ve got a little...,6,male
4008,RON, Bit worried about her.  Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub?  Her and me snogging.  Ha.  As if...,6,male
4009,RON," Harry, she’s swallowing her tongue --",6,male
4010,RON," Believe me, Professor, I’ve been asking myself the same question for six years.",6,male
4011,RON, What do you suppose Dean sees in her?  Ginny.,6,male
4012,RON, Dean?  He’s brilliant.,6,male
4013,RON," Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn’t he?  Something snaps.  You’ve got to hate him.  You know, on principle.",6,male
4014,RON, So what is it?  He sees in her?,6,male
4015,RON, Attractive?,6,male
4016,RON, Skin?  You’re saying Dean’s dating my sister because of her skin?,6,male
4017,RON," Hermione’s got nice skin. Wouldn’t you say?  As skin goes, I mean.",6,male
4018,RON, Right.,6,male
4019,RON, So.  How was it?,6,male
4020,RON, Your dinner party.,6,male
4021,RON, I expect you’ll be going with McLaggen.  Isn’t he a member of the Slug Club?,6,male
4022,RON, Really?,6,male
4023,RON, I’m resigning.  After today’s match.  McLaggen can have my spot.,6,male
4024,RON, Sure...,6,male
4025,RON," C’mon, Harry.  We’ve got a game to win.",6,male
4026,RON, What’s with the birds?,6,male
4027,RON," Look, I can’t help it if she’s got her knickers in a twist.  What Lav and I have -- well, let’s just say there was no stopping it.  It’s chemical.  Will it last?  Who knows?  Point is, I’m a free agent.",6,male
4028,RON, Unbreakable Vow.  You’re sure that’s what Snape said.,6,male
4029,RON," It’s just, well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow.",6,male
4030,RON," No, you don’t understand -- Oh, bloody hell...",6,male
4031,RON, All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.,6,male
4032,RON, You die.,6,male
4033,RON," It’s beautiful, isn’t it?  The moon.",6,male
4034,RON, It was on your bed.  The box. Thought I’d try one...,6,male
4035,RON," I can’t stop thinking about her, Harry.",6,male
4036,RON, She could never annoy me.  I think... I think I love her.,6,male
4037,RON, Do you think she knows I exist?,6,male
4038,RON, Snogging?  Who’re you talking about?,6,male
4039,RON," Romilda, of course.  Romilda Vane.",6,male
4040,RON, It’s no joke!  I’m in love with her!,6,male
4041,RON, No.  Can you introduce me?,6,male
4042,RON, How do I look?,6,male
4043,RON, Where’s Romilda?,6,male
4044,RON," Hello, darling.  Fancy a drink?",6,male
4045,RON, What’s this?,6,male
4046,RON, What happened to me?,6,male
4047,RON, I feel really... bad.,6,male
4048,RON," These girls are gonna kill me, Harry.",6,male
4049,RON, Er... My... Nee... Er!  My!  Nee!,6,male
4050,RON, Huh?,6,male
4051,RON, Tell me again how I broke up with Lavender?,6,male
4052,RON, Don’t get me wrong.  I’m bloody thrilled to be shot of her.  It’s just she seems... a bit put out.,6,male
4053,RON," Well... there is... something. But no.  It can’t be.  Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn’t I?",6,male
4054,RON, You know.  Hide the book.,6,male
4055,RON," Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?",6,male
4056,RON, No.  I got an owl from Dad this morning.  The one at Borgin & Burke’s?  It’s still there.,6,male
4057,RON," Good luck, mate.",6,male
4178,MALFOY, What just happened?  Blaise?,6,male
4179,MALFOY, Hogwarts.  What a pathetic excuse for a school.  I think I’d pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower if I thought I had to continue on for another two years.,6,male
4180,MALFOY, Let’s just say I don’t think you’ll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year.,6,male
4181,MALFOY," Amused, Blaise?  We’ll see just who’s laughing in the end.",6,male
4182,MALFOY, You two go on.  I want to check something.,6,male
4183,MALFOY," Didn’t mummy ever tell you it’s bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? Petrificus Totalus!",6,male
4184,MALFOY," Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin.",6,male
4185,MALFOY, Enjoy the ride back to London.,6,male
4186,MALFOY, Is my father’s.  He’s not dead.,6,male
4187,MALFOY," Nice face, Potter.",6,male
4188,MALFOY," Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy?",6,male
4189,MALFOY, Certainly... Professor.,6,male
4190,MALFOY, I don’t need protection.  I was chosen for this!  Out of all others.  Me!  And I won’t fail him.,6,male
4191,MALFOY, No!  I was chosen.  This is my moment!,6,male
4192,MALFOY, Cruci--,6,male
4193,MALFOY, Don’t touch me!  Don’t you dare touch me!,6,male
4194,MALFOY, Who else is here?  I heard you talking.,6,male
4195,MALFOY, How do you know what I am?  I’ve done things that would shock you.,6,male
4196,MALFOY, He trusts me!  I was chosen!,6,male
4197,MALFOY, Expelliarumus!,6,male
4198,MALFOY, The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement.,6,male
4199,MALFOY, I’ve been mending it.,6,male
4200,MALFOY, In Borgin & Burkes.  They form --,6,male
4201,MALFOY, I don’t want your help!  Don’t you see!  I have to do it!  I have to! I’ve got to kill you or he’ll kill me.,6,male
4222,TOM RIDDLE, Don’t.,6,male
4223,TOM RIDDLE," You’re the doctor, aren’t you?",6,male
4224,TOM RIDDLE," I don’t believe you.  I hear Mrs. Cole talking, her and the rest of the staff.  They want me looked at.  They think I’m different.",6,male
4225,TOM RIDDLE, I’m not mad.,6,male
4226,TOM RIDDLE, Yes.,6,male
4227,TOM RIDDLE, I can make things move -- without touching them.  I can make animals do what I want without training them.  I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.  I can make them hurt... if I want.,6,male
4228,TOM RIDDLE, Who are you?,6,male
4229,TOM RIDDLE, Prove it.,6,male
4230,TOM RIDDLE, I like having things that belonged to other people.  It makes me feel ... close to them.,6,male
4231,TOM RIDDLE, I can speak to snakes too.,6,male
4232,TOM RIDDLE, They find me.  Whisper things.  Is that normal.  For someone like me?,6,male
4233,TOM RIDDLE," Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?",6,male
4234,TOM RIDDLE, Intuition.,6,male
4235,TOM RIDDLE, I know a secret shortcut or two.,6,male
4236,TOM RIDDLE," Yes, sir.  I couldn’t think of anyone else to go to.  The other professors, well, they’re not like you.  They might... misunderstand.",6,male
4237,TOM RIDDLE," I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me...",6,male
4238,TOM RIDDLE," Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?",6,male
4239,TOM RIDDLE, Intuition.,6,male
4240,TOM RIDDLE, I know a secret shortcut or two.,6,male
4241,TOM RIDDLE," Yes, sir.  I couldn’t think of anyone else to go to.  The other Professors, well, they’re not like you.  They might... misunderstand.",6,male
4242,TOM RIDDLE," I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section, and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me.  It’s called, as I understand it... a Horcrux.",6,male
4243,TOM RIDDLE, Horcrux.  I came across the term while reading and I didn’t fully understand it.,6,male
4244,TOM RIDDLE," Yes, sir.  Which is why I came to you.  I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you.",6,male
4245,TOM RIDDLE," Yes, I thought it might be something like that.  But I don’t understand how that works, sir.",6,male
4246,TOM RIDDLE, Protected?,6,male
4247,TOM RIDDLE," How does one split his soul, sir?",6,male
4248,TOM RIDDLE, Murder.,6,male
4249,TOM RIDDLE," Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once?  For instance, isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number --",6,male
4250,TOM RIDDLE," Of course, sir.  And I promise I’ll not speak of our conversation.  It’ll be our little secret...",6,male
4251,HAGRID," Hey, you three!",6,male
4252,HAGRID, Stinksap.  Burn the whiskers right off yer chin.  Trees ‘ere are drippin’ with it.,6,male
4253,HAGRID," It’s not fer me.  It’s fer Aragog. Yeh remember Aragog, don’ yeh?",6,male

4261,HAGRID, I reckon that too... How’d yeh get outta the castle anyways?,6,male
4262,HAGRID," Don’ suppose it’s doin’ ‘im any good, izzit?",6,male

4268,HAGRID, Poof.,6,male
4269,HAGRID, No idea... no idea at all...,6,male
4270,HAGRID," Take more’n tha’ ter finish me off.  Not sure about me ‘ouse, tho’.  But if anybody can put it righ’, Dumbledore can.",6,male
4271,HAGRID, Only thing I can’t reckon is wha’ Snape was doin’ with tha’ lot.,6,male
4272,HAGRID," An’ wha’s this wi’ the Dark Mar’? Who’s been killed? Where’s Dumbledore, ‘arry? Where’s Dumbledore!!",6,male
4273,SCRIMGEOUR," These are dark times, there is no denying.  Our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.  But I say this to our citizenry:  we, ever your servants, continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains strong...",7,male
4274,SCRIMGEOUR," I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter.",7,male
4275,SCRIMGEOUR," Don’t be coy, Mr. Potter.  Mr. Weasley.  Would you say you were close to your former Headmaster?",7,male
4276,SCRIMGEOUR," And you, Miss Granger?  How would you characterize your relationship?",7,male
4277,SCRIMGEOUR," This.  Despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to have been particularly close to their recently deceased Headmaster, he saw fit to remember them in his will.  Now why do you suppose that would be?",7,male
4278,SCRIMGEOUR," Come now, you don’t expect me to believe...",7,male
4279,SCRIMGEOUR," ‘Herein is set forth the Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.  First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, a device of my own making, in the hope that -- when things seem most dark -- it will show him the light.’",7,male
4280,SCRIMGEOUR," ‘To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.’",7,male
4281,SCRIMGEOUR," ‘To Harry James Potter, I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.",7,male
4282,SCRIMGEOUR," Not quite.  Dumbledore left you a second bequest:  The Sword of Godric Gryffindor.  Unfortunately, the Sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore’s to give away.  As an important historical artifact, it belongs...",7,male
4283,SCRIMGEOUR," The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger.  That does not make it that wizard’s property.  And in any event the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown.",7,male
4284,SCRIMGEOUR," The sword is missing. I won’t pretend to be your friend, Mr. Potter.  But I assure you I’m not your enemy.",7,male
4285,SCRIMGEOUR, Dumbledore said something very similar the last time we spoke.,7,male
4286,SCRIMGEOUR, I came alone.  I don’t really need them anymore...,7,male
4486,RON, What are those?,7,male
4487,RON, C’mon.  Mum’s got dinner ready.,7,male
4488,RON," Never done that before, have we?",7,male
4489,RON, I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo.,7,male
4490,RON, Hey ya -- Well... thanks.,7,male
4491,RON, Always the tone of surprise.,7,male
4492,RON," For you?  You think Madeye died for you?  You think George took that curse for you?  You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that.",7,male
4493,RON, And leave Hermione?  Are you mad? We wouldn’t last two days without her.,7,male
4494,RON," Bill and Fleur.  Mum’s been planning it for months.  Only thing that’s kept her sane, I reckon.  She’ll kill me if I miss it.  Kill you too.  Rather go face to face with You-Know-Who if I’m honest.",7,male
4495,RON," Tonight’s not the night, mate. You’d only be doing him a favor.",7,male
4496,RON, Do you think he knows?,7,male
4497,RON," I mean, they’re bits of his soul, the Horcruxes.  Bits of him.  When Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle’s diary all those years ago -- he must’ve felt something right?",7,male
4498,RON," What I’m saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one...",7,male
4499,RON, Won’t he know he’s being hunted?,7,male
4500,RON, Dunno.  But something tells me he didn’t come to give away the bride.,7,male
4501,RON, Dumbledore?  And me?  I dunno.  I reckon I was just another Weasley to him.  He was always polite --,7,male
4502,RON, Dumbledore left this?  For me? Brilliant.  Er -- what is it?,7,male
4503,RON, Wicked.,7,male
4504,RON," Mum used to read me those!  The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty Rabbity and her Cackling Stump...",7,male
4505,RON," Oh, c’mon!  Beedle’s stories are famous!  Babbity Rabbitty?  No...?",7,male
4506,RON, Where are we?,7,male
4507,RON, How the ruddy --,7,male
4508,RON," You’re amazing, you are.",7,male
4509,RON," They were after you, mate.  We’d just put everyone in danger going back.",7,male
4510,RON, What she said.,7,male
4511,RON, So where do we go from here?  The Leaky Cauldron?,7,male
4512,RON, By the way -- these jeans?  Not my favorite.  Bit tight.,7,male
4513,RON, This is Dolohov.  I recognize him from the wanted posters.,7,male
4514,RON," So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn’t you?",7,male
4515,RON, Suppose it’s him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then?,7,male
4516,RON, You’re the boss. Hermione?,7,male
4517,RON, You’re the best with spells.,7,male
4518,RON, Can’t be.  The Trace breaks at seventeen.  It’s Wizarding law.,7,male
4519,RON, What?,7,male
4520,RON," We’ve got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.",7,male
4521,RON, What was that about?,7,male
4522,RON," The two clinging to the tree are Death Eaters for sure.  Dunno ‘bout the bloke on the bench. Can’t see us, of course.  But we’ll have to be careful coming and going.  C’mon.  There’s something else you need to see.",7,male
4523,RON, R... A... B.,7,male
4524,RON, R.A.B. was Sirius’ brother?,7,male
4525,RON, Kreacher...,7,male
4526,RON," You’re a thief, Dung.  Everyone knows it.",7,male
4527,RON, Wicked trainers.,7,male
4528,RON, Piece of advice.  Let’s not rehash old times.  Got it... mate?,7,male
4529,RON, No.  He’s worried he should have got more money for it.,7,male
4530,RON, Right.  So let’s do it.  Who gets who?,7,male
4531,RON," The world’s mental.  Come on, drink up.  We’ve got a Horcrux to find.",7,male
4532,RON, Long story.  Nice meeting you.,7,male
4533,RON, Piss off.,7,male
4534,RON," No, don’t!  Don’t say it!",7,male
4535,RON, It’s taboo -- You-Know-Who’s name. That’s how they track people now. It’s how they found us in the cafe that night.,7,male
4536,RON," I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry.  Blimey, what’s that smell?",7,male
4537,RON, Not bloody likely.  Smells like something Ginny would cook.,7,male
4538,RON, Is that it?,7,male
4539,RON, ... alive.,7,male
4540,RON, It’s angry.,7,male
4541,RON," Seems strange, mate.  Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn’t bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn’t that bother you?",7,male
4542,RON, I’m hungry.,7,male
4543,RON, I’m hungry.,7,male
4544,RON, Leave it.,7,male
4545,RON, Mum can make food appear out of thin air.,7,male
4546,RON," Oh, speak English, can’t you?",7,male
4547,RON, I said leave it.,7,male
4548,RON," Yeah.  Brilliant.  Only, correct me if I’m wrong... wasn’t that yesterday’s plan?  And the day before that?  And the day before that?  Walk.  Sleep.  Walk. Sleep.",7,male
4549,RON," He doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he?",7,male
4550,RON, Wizards were here.,7,male
4551,RON, The sword was stolen.,7,male
4552,RON," Yeah, I’m still here.  But you two carry on.  Don’t let me spoil your fun.",7,male
4553,RON," Problem?  There’s no problem.  Not according to you, anyway.",7,male
4554,RON," All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down because now there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find.",7,male
4555,RON," Yeah, I thought I did too.",7,male
4556,RON," No, I just reckoned after all this time, we’d have actually achieved something.  I reckoned you knew what you were doing.  I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile!  I reckoned you had a plan!",7,male
4557,RON," Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren’t we!",7,male
4558,RON," Don’t lie!  You said it, too, you said you were disappointed --",7,male
4559,RON," Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night?  Do you!  To make sure I don’t hear Ginny’s name or Fred or George or Mum or --",7,male
4560,RON, NO!  YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE!  YOUR PARENTS ARE DEAD!  YOU HAVE NO FAMILY!,7,male
4561,RON, And you?,7,male
4562,RON, Are you staying?  Or coming?,7,male
4563,RON," Fine.  I get it.  I saw you two the other night.  Yeah, that’s right.  Didn’t know I knew, did you?",7,male
4564,RON, Are -- you -- mental?,7,male
4565,RON," Well, yeah.  Bit obvious, I'd think.",7,male
4566,RON, No.  I reckoned it was you.,7,male
4567,RON, Right.  Antlers.,7,male
4568,RON," No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --",7,male
4569,RON, Anything?,7,male
4570,RON," And we did, didn’t we?",7,male
4571,RON," What?  No.  Harry.  That thing’s bad for me.  I can’t handle it. I’m not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.  It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse.",7,male
4572,RON, No.  I can’t --,7,male
4573,RON, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I left.,7,male
4574,RON, Saving your life.,7,male
4575,RON, And just think of it.  Only three to go.,7,male
4576,RON, Hey.,7,male
4577,RON, Wo -- hey -- ouch!,7,male
4578,RON, How come he’s got your wand?,7,male
4579,RON," No, of course not.  I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux!  Why would that change anything!  Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you!  To see you doing those things --",7,male
4580,RON," Look, I wanted to come back the minute I’d left.  I just... didn’t know how to find you.",7,male
4581,RON, With this.,7,male
4582,RON," It doesn’t just turn off lights. I don’t know exactly how it works, but Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I’d given some Snatchers the slip the night before, me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway, I was sleeping when I heard it...",7,male
4583,RON, A voice.,7,male
4584,RON," Your voice, Hermione.  Coming out of this.",7,male
4585,RON, My name.  Just my name.  Like a whisper.,7,male
4586,RON, So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.  And I knew.,7,male
4587,RON," Just knew.  On account of Hermione’s voice.  And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here.",7,male
4588,RON," I could feel it inside me.  It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea.  And I knew it would take me where I needed to go.",7,male
4589,RON, I’ve always liked it.  These flames Hermione makes.,7,male
4590,RON, How long you reckon she’ll stay mad at me?,7,male
4591,RON," It was true.  Every word. You’re going to think I’m mental, but I think that’s why Dumbledore left it to me -- the Deluminator. I think he knew that at some point I’d... need to find my way back. And she’d lead me.",7,male
4592,RON," Bloody hell.  I just realized. You need a wand, right?",7,male
4593,RON," Well, I’ve got one.  Here.  It’s Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it’ll do.  I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back.",7,male
4594,RON, Wo.,7,male
4595,RON," Maybe a bit more practice, eh?",7,male
4596,RON, All right.,7,male
4597,RON, But what does it mean?,7,male
4598,RON, I think Hermione’s right.  I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it?  Those in favor...,7,male
4599,RON," Sorry, Harry.  Looks like it’s Hermione and me this time.",7,male
4600,RON, Luna?,7,male
4601,RON, Keep off the dirigible plums.,7,male
4602,RON, Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty to help Harry?,7,male
4603,RON," He’s mental.  Let’s face it. Luna’s always good value, but she’s nutty as squirrel poo.",7,male
4604,RON," Well, yeah, of course.  It’s massive, isn’t it?",7,male
4605,RON," Yeah, all right...",7,male
4606,RON, Midnight.  Mum always said midnight. But twilight’s fine.  Better actually.,7,male
4607,RON," Let’s get out of here once he’s back.  I’m not touching this stuff, hot or cold.",7,male
4608,RON," You’re supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible.  Dead boring if you ask me.  But an unbeatable wand!",7,male
4609,RON," Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you’d lead.",7,male
4610,RON, Not like Harry’s.  I’ve seen a fair few.  Dad used to bring home the ones the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or tears. Harry’s is different.  It’s perfect.,7,male
4611,RON, You forgot the water.,7,male
4612,RON, For the tea.,7,male
4613,RON, Nooooooooo!,7,male
4614,RON, That treacherous old bleeder!  Is there no one we can trust!,7,male
4615,RON, I’ll do the enchantments.,7,male
4616,RON, Don’t touch her!,7,male
4617,RON, Stan Shunpike.,7,male
4618,RON, Weasley... Barney Weasley.,7,male
4619,RON, Piss off!  Arthur Weasley’s ten times the wizard you are!,7,male
4620,ARTHUR WEASLEY, Close the door.,7,male
4621,ARTHUR WEASLEY," These are for the Order.  So many are on the run now, it helps them to stay connected with the rest of us.  Know they’re not alone...",7,male
4622,ARTHUR WEASLEY, Are we the last?  Where’s George?,7,male
4623,ARTHUR WEASLEY, Remus.  Where’s my son?,7,male
4624,ARTHUR WEASLEY, It doesn’t explain how they knew we were moving Harry tonight.,7,male
4625,ARTHUR WEASLEY, One.  Two.  Three!,7,male
4626,ARTHUR WEASLEY," How’s it look on your end, boys?",7,male
4627,ARTHUR WEASLEY," I understand, Wakinda, but I can’t be a party to that.",7,male
4628,ARTHUR WEASLEY," Hello, Reg.  Isn’t Mary in for questioning today?  Try to have faith.  If there’s anything Molly and I can do for you --",7,male
4629,ARTHUR WEASLEY, Tell him to try an umbrella.,7,male
4630,ARTHUR WEASLEY," Is that a threat, Runcorn?",7,male
4631,VOLDEMORT, Severus.  I was beginning to worry you’d lost your way.  Come.  I’ve saved you a seat.,7,male
4632,VOLDEMORT," You know our hosts, of course, Severus.  Narcissa in particular has been most hospitable.  Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my presence.  Are you, Lucius?",7,male
4633,VOLDEMORT, Are you burdened?,7,male
4634,VOLDEMORT," You bring news I trust, Severus?",7,male
4635,VOLDEMORT, And this information comes --,7,male
4636,VOLDEMORT," Pius, what say you?",7,male
4637,VOLDEMORT," Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.  Where will he be taken?  The boy?",7,male
4638,VOLDEMORT, Wormtail!  Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?,7,male
4639,VOLDEMORT," As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.  But I face an unfortunate complication.  It has recently come to my attention that my wand and Potter’s share the same core. They are, in some ways, twins.  We can wound but not fatally harm one another.  Which means, if I am to kill him... I will have to do it with another’s wand.",7,male
4640,VOLDEMORT," Come now.  Surely one of you would like the honor?  What about... you, Lucius?",7,male
4641,VOLDEMORT, I require your wand.,7,male
4642,VOLDEMORT, Do I detect elm?,7,male
4643,VOLDEMORT, And the core?,7,male
4644,VOLDEMORT, My wand?  You can’t possibly think I would give you my wand.,7,male
4645,VOLDEMORT," For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Her specialty was Muggle studies. It is Miss Burbage’s belief that Muggles are not so different from us.",7,male
4646,VOLDEMORT, Avada Kedavra!,7,male
4647,VOLDEMORT, Nagini... Dinner.,7,male
4648,VOLDEMORT, Avada...,7,male
4649,VOLDEMORT," Perhaps our friend’s loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail.",7,male
4650,VOLDEMORT," You wouldn’t be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch?  Because, I must tell you... that will only make it worse for you...",7,male
4651,VOLDEMORT, Who was he?  The thief?,7,male
4652,VOLDEMORT, I believe you...,7,male
4653,VOLDEMORT," If not you, then who?",7,male
4654,VOLDEMORT," Tell me, Grindelwald.  Tell me where to find it!  Tell me who possesses it!  The name, Grindelwald!  The name!",7,male
4655,HARRY, Time for the teary farewell.,7,male
4656,HARRY," They’ll torture you.  Even Dudley. If they think you know where I’m going, they’ll stop at noth--",7,male
4657,HARRY, Do you have any?  Magic?,7,male
4658,HARRY," Absolutely not.  Besides, I’m just a waste of space.  Isn’t that right, Vernon?",7,male
4659,HARRY, Well... thanks.,7,male
4660,HARRY," See you, Big D.",7,male
4661,HARRY, Good riddance.,7,male
4662,HARRY," I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley.",7,male
4663,HARRY, The Trace?,7,male
4664,HARRY, The real one...?,7,male
4665,HARRY, No!  Absolutely not!,7,male
4666,HARRY, If you think I’m going to let people risk their lives for me --,7,male
4667,HARRY, This is different.  Taking that. Becoming me -- no.,7,male
4668,HARRY," Blimey, Hermione!",7,male
4669,HARRY, Here.,7,male
4670,HARRY, Hagrid!  We’ve got to help the others!,7,male
4671,HARRY, What was that?,7,male
4672,HARRY, Hagrid... HAGRID...!,7,male
4673,HARRY, Is no one back yet?,7,male
4674,HARRY, Are you mad...?,7,male
4675,HARRY, A grindylow!,7,male
4676,HARRY, Who did this to him?,7,male
4677,HARRY, Hedwig -- I think.  She was trying to protect me --,7,male
4678,HARRY," I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood?",7,male
4679,HARRY, No one else is going to die.  Not for me.,7,male
4680,HARRY, Come with me.  Now.,7,male
4681,HARRY, Wedding?,7,male
4682,HARRY, I don’t care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes.  It’s the only chance we have to beat him.  And the longer we wait the stronger he gets.,7,male
4683,HARRY, Yes.,7,male
4684,HARRY," Dumbledore didn’t want anyone to know what it is we’re doing.  If I tell you, I’d be betraying him.",7,male
4685,HARRY, Maybe that’s the best reason to have it.  Because of everything that’s going on.,7,male
4686,HARRY," To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?",7,male
4687,HARRY, And this would be...?,7,male
4688,HARRY, What’s this all about?,7,male
4689,HARRY, No idea.,7,male
4690,HARRY, That’s it then?,7,male
4691,HARRY, Excuse me?,7,male
4692,HARRY," You’ll forgive me, Minister.  But it’s a little hard to tell the difference these days.",7,male
4693,HARRY, You mean -- But that’s brilliant -- I... don’t know what to say.,7,male
4694,HARRY," No, ‘course not.  How are you, Luna?",7,male
4695,HARRY," Nice to meet you, sir.",7,male
4696,HARRY, Sir?  May I sit down?,7,male
4697,HARRY," I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet very moving, sir.  I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?",7,male
4698,HARRY," I never even knew he had a brother, sir.",7,male
4699,HARRY," Sir, I was wondering if you’d had much contact with him before he died.",7,male
4700,HARRY," Strange, sir?",7,male
4701,HARRY," Could you tell me from where they’d come, sir?",7,male
4702,HARRY, Just curious.  I was... close to Professor Dumbledore.,7,male
4703,HARRY, Who are you talking about?,7,male
4704,HARRY, Who?,7,male
4705,HARRY," Oh, right.  Slipped my mind...",7,male
4706,HARRY, Godric’s Hollow?  Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow?,7,male
4707,HARRY, Excuse me?  You don’t mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?,7,male
4708,HARRY, Do you reckon everyone’s alright at the wedding?  Maybe we should --,7,male
4709,HARRY, Same.,7,male
4710,HARRY, My rucksack.  With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow --,7,male
4711,HARRY, You’re joking.,7,male
4712,HARRY, DOWN!,7,male
4713,HARRY, Stupefy!,7,male
4714,HARRY," Lock the door, get the lights.",7,male
4715,HARRY, This one’s name is Rowle.  He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.,7,male
4716,HARRY," It’s better we wipe their memories.  We kill them, they’ll know we were here.",7,male
4717,HARRY, How is it they knew we were there?,7,male
4718,HARRY, Hermione.  I appreciate the thought -- honestly.  But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...,7,male
4719,HARRY, I have an idea.,7,male
4720,HARRY, Mad-Eye...?,7,male
4721,HARRY," Yeah.  They knew her.  She wrote A History of Magic, you know.",7,male
4722,HARRY, I’m thinking maybe we should go talk to her.  She still lives in Godric’s Hollow.  I’m thinking maybe she could help us.,7,male
4723,HARRY, To the Dark Lord.  I know I will be dead long before you read this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it...,7,male
4724,HARRY," Been spying on us, have you?",7,male
4725,HARRY, Ever seen this before?,7,male
4726,HARRY," Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me.  Which means I own you too.",7,male
4727,HARRY," That’s right.  But there were two, weren’t there?",7,male
4728,HARRY, Where’s the other one?,7,male
4729,HARRY, Answer her.,7,male
4730,HARRY, How do you mean?,7,male
4731,HARRY," Where is it now?  Did someone take it, Kreacher?",7,male
4732,HARRY," Who, Kreacher?  Who was it?",7,male
4733,HARRY, Find him.,7,male
4734,HARRY, You mean... it remembers me?,7,male
4735,HARRY," When you turned this place over -- don’t deny it! -- you found a locket, am I right?",7,male
4736,HARRY, Who was she?  This witch?,7,male
4737,HARRY, It gets really tricky.,7,male
4738,HARRY, This is completely mental.,7,male
4739,HARRY, Accio Dittany.,7,male
4740,HARRY, Hermione.  His arm --,7,male
4741,HARRY, What happened?  I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place.,7,male
4742,HARRY, Don’t be stupid.,7,male
4743,HARRY, What’re you doing?,7,male
4744,HARRY, Tent?  Where am I supposed to find --,7,male
4745,HARRY, They’re great.,7,male
4746,HARRY, No problem.,7,male
4747,HARRY, How bad is he?,7,male
4748,HARRY," Dumbledore had a theory.  He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects.  And he felt they wouldn’t be hidden randomly either.  We know of three so far.  The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to Tom Riddle’s grandfather.  The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother.",7,male
4749,HARRY, How d’you know?,7,male
4750,HARRY," I know.  I felt it too. It’s... it’s like it’s ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it’s --",7,male
4751,HARRY, That’s why we’re going to kill it.,7,male
4752,HARRY, Dissendium!,7,male
4753,HARRY, Expulso!,7,male
4754,HARRY, We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it.,7,male
4755,HARRY, No.,7,male
4756,HARRY," It’s not a candle I can blow out, Hermione.  It always burns, even if it’s just a flicker.  Can you understand that?",7,male
4757,HARRY, He’s found him.  Vol--,7,male
4758,HARRY, You-Know-Who.  He’s found Gregorovitch --,7,male
4759,HARRY, Yes.  How’d you know?,7,male
4760,HARRY, You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what.  But he’s desperate to have it.  It’s as if his life depends on it.,7,male
4761,HARRY, Well it sets my teeth on edge. What’s he expecting to hear?  Good news?,7,male
4762,HARRY, And what gets you through the day?,7,male
4763,HARRY, How long before he can travel?,7,male
4764,HARRY, You’re not doing enough.,7,male
4765,HARRY, Loads.,7,male
4766,HARRY, Good to know your enchantments work.,7,male
4767,HARRY, We have to leave.  We’re not safe here.,7,male
4768,HARRY, Then we’ll go by foot.,7,male
4769,HARRY, What?,7,male
4770,HARRY, We’re all hungry.,7,male
4771,HARRY, It’ll be dark soon.  We need to find a place to sleep.,7,male
4772,HARRY, My turn.,7,male
4773,HARRY, What?,7,male
4774,HARRY, Maybe you could tell me now.,7,male
4775,HARRY, Brilliant.,7,male
4776,HARRY, O-kay.,7,male
4777,HARRY, With a basilisk fang.  If you tell me you’ve got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours --,7,male
4778,HARRY, It only takes in that which makes it stronger...,7,male
4779,HARRY, ... it can destroy Horcruxes.,7,male
4780,HARRY," You’re brilliant, Hermione. Truly.",7,male
4781,HARRY, There’s only one problem...,7,male
4782,HARRY, What’s the problem?,7,male
4783,HARRY," Look, don’t be shy.  If you’ve got something to say, spit it out.",7,male
4784,HARRY, I thought you knew what you signed up for.,7,male
4785,HARRY, I don’t understand.  What part of this isn’t living up to your expectations?  Did you think we’d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?,7,male
4786,HARRY," I’ve told you everything Dumbledore told me!  And in case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found a Horcrux!",7,male
4787,HARRY," Yeah, he would.  D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?  D’you think I haven’t guessed what you were thinking?",7,male
4788,HARRY, You think I don’t listen!  You think I don’t know what it’s like --,7,male
4789,HARRY, Go then.  But leave that.,7,male
4790,HARRY, Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...,7,male
4791,HARRY, Hermione.,7,male
4792,HARRY, You were right.  It’s like you said.  Snitches have flesh memories.  But I didn’t catch my first Snitch with my hand.  I almost swallowed it.,7,male
4793,HARRY, What do you reckon it means?,7,male
4794,HARRY," Luna’s dad was wearing that, at Ron- At Bill and Fleur’s wedding.",7,male
4795,HARRY, Around his neck.  Like an amulet. I didn’t think much of it at the time.  You know Luna -- she’s always got some mad thing or the other she’s carrying around.  I just figured it ran in the family.,7,male
4796,HARRY," Hermione, I’ve been thinking.  I -- I want to go to Godric’s Hollow. It’s where I was born, it’s where my parents died --",7,male
4797,HARRY," But it means something to him too, Hermione.  You-Know-Who nearly died there.  Wouldn’t that be just the kind of place he’d hide a Horcrux?",7,male
4798,HARRY," Godric’s Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean, ‘course it is.  Obvious, isn’t it?",7,male
4799,HARRY, Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might’ve popped open.,7,male
4800,HARRY, Hermione...,7,male
4801,HARRY, No.  This is where I was born. I’m not returning as someone else.,7,male
4802,HARRY, Do you think they’d be in there? My mum and dad?,7,male
4803,HARRY, Is it -- ?,7,male
4804,HARRY, No.,7,male
4805,HARRY," Happy Christmas, Hermione.",7,male
4806,HARRY, Yeah.,7,male
4807,HARRY, C’mon.,7,male
4808,HARRY, We look like ordinary Muggles.,7,male
4809,HARRY, Relax.  This is right.  I know it.,7,male
4810,HARRY," This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them.",7,male
4811,HARRY," You’re Bathilda, aren’t you?",7,male
4812,HARRY," Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides, she’s barely knee-high to a house-elf.  I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly.",7,male
4813,HARRY," She’s gaga, remember?",7,male
4814,HARRY, Here.  Let me do that.,7,male
4815,HARRY, Miss Bagshot?  Who is this man?,7,male
4816,HARRY, His name.  Can you tell me his name?,7,male
4817,HARRY," This is him, Hermione.  The one I saw in Gregorovitch’s wandshop. The thief.  Miss Bagshot, who is he?",7,male
4818,HARRY, She wants us to go upstairs.,7,male
4819,HARRY, She wants me to go.  Alone.,7,male
4820,HARRY, It’s all right.  You stay here.,7,male
4821,HARRY, Lumos.,7,male
4822,HARRY, Yes.,7,male
4823,HARRY, Where are they?,7,male
4824,HARRY," Who is he, Hermione?  The thief? Did Dumbledore know him?",7,male
4825,HARRY, Well?,7,male
4826,HARRY," Tell me, Hermione.  Who is he?",7,male
4827,HARRY," Hermione, I don’t need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is.",7,male
4828,HARRY," Get to the hard part, Hermione.",7,male
4829,HARRY, And Dumbledore believed in it?,7,male
4830,HARRY, ‘For the Greater Good.’  What does that mean?,7,male
4831,HARRY," We’re young, Hermione.  And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported.",7,male
4832,HARRY, Where’s my wand?  I’ll take the watch.,7,male
4833,HARRY, Hermione.  Where’s my wand?,7,male
4834,HARRY, It’s done.,7,male
4835,HARRY, It’s done.,7,male
4836,HARRY, Leave me yours.  You get back in the warm.  And give me that.,7,male
4837,HARRY, No...,7,male
4838,HARRY, Lumos!,7,male
4839,HARRY, Accio Sword.,7,male
4840,HARRY, Diffindo.,7,male
4841,HARRY, Hermione...,7,male
4842,HARRY, It was you!,7,male
4843,HARRY, And the doe.  That was you as well.,7,male
4844,HARRY, My Patronus is a stag.,7,male
4845,HARRY, You didn’t see anyone else?,7,male
4846,HARRY," But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we’d find it.",7,male
4847,HARRY, See that?  It knows.  It’s afraid. Do it.,7,male
4848,HARRY, All the more reason.,7,male
4849,HARRY, Then why are you here?  Why did you come back?,7,male
4850,HARRY," I’ll have to speak to it in order for it to open.  When it does, don’t hesitate.  I don’t know what’s in here, but it’ll put up a fight.  The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me.",7,male
4851,HARRY, On three.  One.  Two.  Three. Take me inside...,7,male
4852,HARRY," Stab it, Ron.  Now.",7,male
4853,HARRY, Don’t listen to it.,7,male
4854,HARRY, Ron.  Don’t listen to it!,7,male
4855,HARRY, Ron.  Stab it!,7,male
4856,HARRY, Ron.  It lies!  Stab it!  STAB IT!,7,male
4857,HARRY," Do it, Ron!  Kill it!",7,male
4858,HARRY," After you left, she cried for a week.  She’s like my sister.",7,male
4859,HARRY, You’ve sort of made up for it tonight.  Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux.,7,male
4860,HARRY, That too.,7,male
4861,HARRY, Fine.  Actually... more than fine.,7,male
4862,HARRY, Um... I don’t know?,7,male
4863,HARRY, It’s a long story.,7,male
4864,HARRY, It’s a long story.,7,male
4865,HARRY, Exactly how did you find us?,7,male
4866,HARRY, It?,7,male
4867,HARRY, Knew what?,7,male
4868,HARRY, Keep talking ‘bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she’ll come round.,7,male
4869,HARRY, Yeah...,7,male
4870,HARRY, Engorgio.,7,male
4871,HARRY, Reducio!,7,male
4872,HARRY, Sorry?,7,male
4873,HARRY, Jesus.  It was there too.,7,male
4874,HARRY, Outside Gregorovitch’s wand shop. on the alley wall...,7,male
4875,HARRY," Not still mad at him, are you?",7,male
4876,HARRY," Hello, Mr. Lovegood.  I’m Harry Potter.  We met a few months back?",7,male
4877,HARRY," Would it be okay if we came in? It won’t take long, sir.  I promise.",7,male
4878,HARRY," Well, sir, we need some help.",7,male
4879,HARRY, What’s going on here?,7,male
4880,HARRY," Well, sir, it’s about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding.  A symbol...",7,male
4881,HARRY," Yes!  Exactly.  What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it?",7,male
4882,HARRY, Sorry... I still don’t really understand...,7,male
4883,HARRY, Which one would you choose if you could?  Of the Deathly Hallows?,7,male
4884,HARRY, The Stone.,7,male
4885,HARRY," Well, you could bring people back, couldn’t you?  Mad-Eye. Dumbledore.  Sirius.  Anybody.",7,male
4886,HARRY, But I have one.  The Invisibility Cloak my father left me.,7,male
4887,HARRY," And I think I’ve actually held the Resurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore’s office when he showed me the ring he’d destroyed, the Horcrux.  It had a symbol on it.  Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows.",7,male
4888,HARRY, Sir?,7,male
4889,HARRY," Who took her, sir?",7,male
4890,HARRY, They’ve kidnapped Luna because he supported me.  He was just desperate.,7,male
4891,HARRY, They exist.  The Hallows.,7,male
4892,HARRY," But he only wants the one, the last one.  That’s what he’s been looking for.",7,male
4893,HARRY," He knows where it is, You-Know- Who.  He’ll have it by the end of the night.  He’s found the Elder Wand.",7,male
4894,HARRY, Dudely.  Vernon Dudley.,7,male
4895,HARRY, The list is wrong.  I told you who I am --,7,male
4896,HARRY, What did you put on me?,7,male
4897,HARRY, How long will it last?,7,male
4898,HAGRID," All righ’, ‘arry?  Yeh look fit.",7,male
4899,HAGRID, Brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a Bowtruckle.  Seems only righ’ I should be the one ter take yeh away.,7,male
4900,HAGRID," Can’t do it, ‘arry.  My job’s ter get you where we’re goin’ safe ‘n sound -- Mad-Eye’s orders!",7,male
4901,HAGRID, Dragon fire!,7,male
4902,HAGRID," Hol’ tight, ‘arry!  We’ve got ter get yeh out of here!",7,male
4903,HAGRID," They were on us from the star’, Molly -- the Death Eaters.  And You-Know-Who as well.",7,male
4904,HAGRID," Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly?  Fer medicinal purposes?",7,male
4905,HAGRID, Someone else is back.,7,male
4906,HAGRID," Wha’?  One of us?  Tha’s mad.  I’d wager me life it wasn’ none of you lot.  An’ if it was me I’d kno’, wouldn’ I?  Talk in me sleep on occasion, I’ll admit, but there’s only Fang aroun’ ter hear an’ mostly it’s gibberish an’ besides I’d cut me tongue out ‘fore ‘d betray ‘arry e’en in me dreams --",7,male
4907,HAGRID, Wha’s so funny!,7,male
4908,MAD-EYE," Yeah, he’s ruddy gorgeous.  What say we get undercover before someone murders him.",7,male
4909,MAD-EYE," All right, all right!  You’ll all have time for a cozy catch-up later!  We’ve got to get the hell out of here and soon!",7,male
4910,MAD-EYE," Potter, you’re underage, which means you’ve still got the Trace on you.",7,male
4911,MAD-EYE," You sneeze and the Ministry will know who wipes your nose.  Point is, we have to use those means of transport the Trace can’t detect: brooms, thestrals and the like. We’ll go in pairs.  That way if anyone’s out there waiting for us -- and I reckon there will be -- they won’t know which Harry Potter is the real one.",7,male
4912,MAD-EYE, I believe you’re familiar with this particular brew.,7,male
4913,MAD-EYE," Everyone here’s of age, Potter, and they’ve all agreed to take the risk.",7,male
4914,MAD-EYE," Nip it, Mundungus!  All right, Granger, as discussed.",7,male
4915,MAD-EYE," Straight in here, if you please.",7,male
4916,MAD-EYE," For those of you who haven’t taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning.  It tastes like goblin piss.",7,male
4917,MAD-EYE, Not yet you aren’t.,7,male
4918,MAD-EYE," Fancy this:  You’re not you, so shut it and strip. You’ll need to change too, Potter.",7,male
4919,MAD-EYE, Blimey.  I almost forgot.,7,male
4920,MAD-EYE," Right then.  We’ll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector. As for you, Harry...",7,male
4921,MAD-EYE," The real Harry!  Where the devil are you, anyway?",7,male
4922,MAD-EYE, You’ll ride with Hagrid.,7,male
4923,MAD-EYE," Yeah, it’s all very touching. Let’s go.",7,male
4924,MAD-EYE," Good luck, everyone.  On the count of three.  One... two --",7,male
4925,FRED, Wasn’t always this handsome.,7,male
4926,FRED," Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.",7,male
4927,FRED," Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye?",7,male
4928,FRED, Just trying to defuse the tension.,7,male
4929,FRED," Yes, don’t fancy this color at all.",7,male
4930,FRED," How do you feel, Georgie?",7,male
4931,FRED, Come again?,7,male
4932,FRED," With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you go for holey?  Pathetic.",7,male
4933,FRED, Better.,7,male
4934,FRED, Brilliant!,7,male
4935,LUPIN," Just remember, Fleur, once you’re married:  Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.",7,male
4936,LUPIN, The house!  Quickly!,7,male
4937,LUPIN, What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts!,7,male
4938,LUPIN, WHAT CREATURE!,7,male
4939,LUPIN, We’ve been betrayed.  Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you weren’t an imposter.,7,male
4940,LUPIN," Snape. He’ll be fine, Molly.  But that’s Dark Magic.  The damage is done.",7,male
4941,LUPIN, ‘Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.’,7,male
4942,LUPIN, Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be with the most skilled Auror.  He knew he’d be in the most danger.,7,male
4943,LUPIN, Understood.,7,male
4944,LUPIN, Say yes.,7,male
4945,LUPIN, Harry!  Go!  Go!,7,male
4946,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!  Xenophilius Lovegood. We live just over the hill!,7,male
4947,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD," I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler, unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during his lifetime and in his death support you just as fully.",7,male
4948,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, What is it? Who are you? What do you want --,7,male
4949,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, Excuse me.,7,male
4950,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD," So.  What brings you here, Mr. Potter?",7,male
4951,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD," Ah.  Help.  I see.  Yes, well, the thing is, helping Harry Potter, rather dangerous these days...",7,male
4952,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD," I have expressed that view, yes. In the past.  Would you excuse me one moment.  I shall return shortly and, um, try to help you...",7,male
4953,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?  We make it ourselves.,7,male
4954,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD," Luna?  Oh, um, she’ll be along. Now how can I help you, Mr. Potter?",7,male
4955,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, You mean this?,7,male
4956,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD," What is it?  Well, it’s the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course.",7,male
4957,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, The Deathly Hallows.  I assume you’re all familiar with ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers?’,7,male
4958,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD," Well, there’s no real reason to go on unless one is familiar with the tale.  Why don’t you read it aloud, Miss...?",7,male
4959,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD," Well, there you are.  Those are the Deathly Hallows.",7,male
4960,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, The Elder Wand,7,male
4961,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, The Resurrection Stone,7,male
4962,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, The Cloak of Invisibility. Together... they make the Deathly Hallows.  Together... they make one master of Death.,7,male
4963,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, Ignotus and his brothers Cadmus and Antioch are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows and therefore the inspiration for the story.,7,male
4964,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD," Ah, but your tea’s grown cold. Excuse me, I'll be right back.",7,male
4965,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, The water?,7,male
4966,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD," Did, didn’t I?  How silly of me.",7,male
4967,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD," No, you mustn’t --",7,male
4968,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD," You’re my only hope.  They were angry, you see, about what I’d been writing, so they took her. They took my Luna... But it’s really you they want...",7,male
4969,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, Him.  Surely you call him You-Know- Who.  But his real name of course is... Voldemort.,7,male
4970,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD, Stop!  I’ve got him --,7,male
4971,ELPHIAS DOGE, Mr. Potter!  By all means!,7,male
4972,ELPHIAS DOGE," I certainly knew him the longest, if you don’t count his brother Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.",7,male
4973,ELPHIAS DOGE," Yes, well, Dumbledore was always very private.  Even as a boy.",7,male
4974,ELPHIAS DOGE, The occasional owl.  Though it was strange...,7,male
4975,ELPHIAS DOGE, It was the owls themselves.  They often arrived in distress.  It was clear they’d traveled great distances in some cases.,7,male
4976,ELPHIAS DOGE," I’m afraid not.  Albus’ messages mostly referenced our days together as schoolboys.  They were surprisingly intimate.  When he did speak of his current activities his words would turn elliptical.  Still, I sensed he was under great stress.  Why do you ask?",7,male
4977,ELPHIAS DOGE," Well, he treasured you, Mr. Potter, I can attest to that.  I can also tell you that when a person passes, it’s only natural to rue the things left unsaid, to regret the question never asked. I knew Albus nigh on 100 years, but in many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me.",7,male
4978,ELPHIAS DOGE," That woman is a vulture, Muriel, and you well know it.",7,male
4979,ELPHIAS DOGE," I’m sorry you think so, Muriel.  I assure you I was writing from the heart.",7,male
4980,ELPHIAS DOGE, A monstrous betrayal.  I can only conclude the rumors are true and that she has become untethered.,7,male
4981,ELPHIAS DOGE," Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter!",7,male
4982,KREACHER, Kreacher has been... watching. Kreacher always watches.,7,male
4983,KREACHER, That was Master Regulus’ locket.,7,male
4984,KREACHER, Kreacher doesn’t know where the other locket is.,7,male
4985,KREACHER, Filthy Mudblood -- The Death Eaters will soon be coming for you!,7,male
4986,KREACHER, Blood-traitor Weasley --,7,male
4987,KREACHER," Yes.  It was here, in this house. A most evil object...",7,male
4988,KREACHER," Before he died, Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to destroy it. It was the last thing he asked of Kreacher.  But no matter how Kreacher tried, he could not..",7,male
4989,KREACHER," He came in the night.  He took many things, including the locket.",7,male
4990,KREACHER, Mundungus.  Mundungus Fletcher.,7,male
4991,KREACHER," As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher!",7,male
5043,HARRY, What did you put on me?,8,male
5044,HARRY, How long will it last?,8,male
5045,HARRY, Luna...?,8,male
5046,HARRY," Hello, sir.",8,male
5047,HARRY, Help us.,8,male
5048,HARRY, Dobby.  What’re you doing here?,8,male
5049,HARRY, Do you mean to say you can Apparate in and out of here?  And take us with you?,8,male
5050,HARRY," Right.  Dobby, I want you to take Luna and Mr. Ollivander to --",8,male
5051,HARRY, You’ll see to Mr. Ollivander?,8,male
5052,HARRY, Stupefy!,8,male
5053,HARRY, Stupefy!,8,male
5054,HARRY, Give the Dark Lord our regards.,8,male
5055,HARRY," It’s all right, Hermione.  You’re safe.  We’re all safe.",8,male
5056,HARRY, Dobby... no...,8,male
5057,HARRY," It’s okay... Here... Just hold on, Dobby... I’ll fix you -- Hermione -- your bag -- you must have something -- Essence of Dittany -- something... Hermione!  Help me!",8,male
5058,HARRY, I want to bury him properly. Without magic.,8,male
5059,HARRY, I need to talk to the goblin.,8,male
5060,HARRY, How are you?,8,male
5061,HARRY, You probably don’t remember --,8,male
5062,HARRY, Yes.,8,male
5063,HARRY, Why did you leave Gringotts?,8,male
5064,HARRY," I need to get inside Gringotts, into one of the vaults.",8,male
5065,HARRY," Alone, yes.  With you, no.",8,male
5066,HARRY, It’s complicated.  Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?,8,male
5067,HARRY, The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need.  We didn’t steal it.,8,male
5068,HARRY, And she never suspected?,8,male
5069,HARRY, And in Madam Lestrange’s vault as well?,8,male
5070,HARRY, I have gold.  Lots of it.,8,male
5071,HARRY, Then what?,8,male
5072,HARRY, All right.,8,male
5073,HARRY," She was terrified when she thought we’d been in there.  She kept asking you what else we’d taken. I’d bet anything there’s a Horcrux there.  If we find it, we can kill it.  And if we kill it, we’re one step closer to killing him.",8,male
5074,HARRY, I’m still working on that part.,8,male
5075,HARRY," Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions.",8,male
5076,HARRY," Can you identify these, sir?",8,male
5077,HARRY, And this?,8,male
5078,HARRY, Was?  Isn’t it still?,8,male
5079,HARRY, You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings.  Can think.,8,male
5080,HARRY," What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?",8,male
5081,HARRY," But you, sir?  Do you believe they exist?",8,male
5082,HARRY, You’re lying.  You know one exists and you told him about it.  You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.,8,male
5083,HARRY," He has found it, sir.",8,male
5084,HARRY," That’s all, sir.  We’ll leave you to get some rest now.",8,male
5085,HARRY," Then I guess I’ll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir.",8,male
5086,HARRY, I reckon you should take this then.,8,male
5087,HARRY," If I can hold it, you can.",8,male
5088,HARRY, I’ll know.  I can’t explain.  It’s like... ... they sing to me.,8,male
5089,HARRY, No.  I just know.  When one’s near.,8,male
5090,HARRY, In the morning.,8,male
5091,HARRY, He’ll be leaving too.,8,male
5092,HARRY," Yeah.  Funny.  Listen, Luna, about your father, I don’t want you to think I --",8,male
5093,HARRY, Hogwarts?,8,male
5094,HARRY," It’s not the place you left, you know.  It’s not the same.",8,male
5095,HARRY, Wouldn’t know you if I didn’t know you.,8,male
5096,HARRY," Sirius gave it to me.  He had a matching piece.  He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it.",8,male
5097,HARRY, Something like that.  I don’t know.  He died before I ever got to use it.  The thing is...,8,male
5098,HARRY," You’ll think I’m mental, but more than once, when I’ve looked into it -- I think I’ve seen Dumbledore.",8,male
5099,HARRY," You can give that to Hermione to hold, all right, Griphook?",8,male
5100,HARRY, C’mon.  Let’s do it.,8,male
5101,HARRY, How long before they come after us?,8,male
5102,HARRY," What is that, Griphook?",8,male
5103,HARRY, Griphook!  What is that!,8,male
5104,HARRY, Well done.  Hey. You look like... you.,8,male
5105,HARRY, That’s it.  Up there.,8,male
5106,HARRY, Give me the sword!  The real one.,8,male
5107,HARRY," We have a deal, Griphook.",8,male
5108,HARRY, Griphook!  Griphook!,8,male
5109,HARRY, Come on!,8,male
5110,HARRY, We’re dropping!,8,male
5111,HARRY, NOW!,8,male
5112,HARRY, He knows.,8,male
5113,HARRY, You-Know-Who.  He knows we broke into Gringotts.  He knows what we took.  He knows we’re hunting Horcruxes.,8,male
5114,HARRY, I saw him.,8,male
5115,HARRY," I can’t always help it, Hermione! Maybe I can.  I don’t know.",8,male
5116,HARRY, He’s angry.  But he’s scared too. He’s going to make sure the other Horcruxes are safe.,8,male
5117,HARRY, I reckon he’ll do anything to stop us from finding the rest.  There’s more:  one of them’s at Hogwarts.,8,male
5118,HARRY," I saw the castle.  And Rowena Ravenclaw.  I think it must have something to do with her.  We have to go there, now.",8,male
5119,HARRY," Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked?  We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose.",8,male
5120,HARRY, We’ll go to Hogsmeade.  To Honeydukes.  Take the secret passage in the cellar.,8,male
5121,HARRY," There’s something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts.  Now everything feels disconnected.",8,male
5122,HARRY," No.  It’s more like he’s wounded. If anything, he feels more dangerous.",8,male
5123,HARRY, Expecto Patronum!,8,male
5124,HARRY, You’re Aberforth.,8,male
5125,HARRY, Dumbledore’s brother.  It’s you I’ve been seeing -- here.  It’s you who sent Dobby.,8,male
5126,HARRY, He’s dead.,8,male
5127,HARRY, How’d you come by it?,8,male
5128,HARRY, Dung had no right selling you that.  It belonged to --,8,male
5129,HARRY, We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do.,8,male
5130,HARRY, We’ve been hunting Horcruxes.  We think the last one’s in the school.  But we’ll need your help getting in.,8,male
5131,HARRY," Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through.",8,male
5132,HARRY, Why should he...,8,male
5133,HARRY, I only care about the Dumbledore I knew.  I trusted him.,8,male
5134,HARRY, I had no reason not to --,8,male
5135,HARRY, You’re drunk.,8,male
5136,HARRY," Because I need to.  Because if I don’t, I don’t know who I am anymore.  I’ve lost too many people to lie down now.  I’m not interested in what happened between you and your brother, I don’t even care that you’ve given up.  I trust the man I knew.  I’m going to see this through. I need to get into the castle tonight.",8,male
5137,HARRY, Where’ve you sent her?,8,male
5138,HARRY," Neville, you look...",8,male
5139,HARRY, The Carrows?,8,male
5140,HARRY," Okay.  There’s something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle.  It could help us defeat You-Know-Who.",8,male
5141,HARRY, We don’t know.,8,male
5142,HARRY, Don’t know that either.,8,male
5143,HARRY, I realize it’s not much to go on.,8,male
5144,HARRY," I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw.  It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas?",8,male
5145,HARRY, Hey there.,8,male
5146,HARRY," It would seem that, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster.",8,male
5147,HARRY, And I’m afraid it’s rather extensive.,8,male
5148,HARRY, How dare you stand where he stood.,8,male
5149,HARRY," Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him.  Tell them!",8,male
5150,HARRY, I’m a Gryffindor.,8,male
5151,HARRY, Time.  As much as you can give me.,8,male
5152,HARRY," Is that possible, Professor?",8,male
5153,HARRY, I think you’re right.,8,male
5154,HARRY," You, too, Professor.",8,male
5155,HARRY, What’re you saying?,8,male
5156,HARRY, Okay.  But take this.  That way you can find me when you get back.,8,male
5157,HARRY, Ravenclaw Common Room.  Got to start somewhere.,8,male
5158,HARRY," I’m a bit preoccupied right now, Luna.",8,male
5159,HARRY," We’ll talk later, Luna.",8,male
5160,HARRY, Later.,8,male
5161,HARRY," Okay, Luna.  Who’ve you got in mind?",8,male
5162,HARRY, Aren’t you coming?,8,male
5163,HARRY, It’s you...,8,male
5164,HARRY," You’re the Grey Lady, the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower.",8,male
5165,HARRY," I’m sorry.  It’s Helena, isn’t it? Helena Ravenclaw.  Rowena’s daughter.  Luna told me.",8,male
5166,HARRY, Yes.  She thought you might be able to help me.,8,male
5167,HARRY, Yes!  That’s right --,8,male
5168,HARRY, Wait!  Please!,8,male
5169,HARRY, But I don’t care about its powers! Honestly --,8,male
5170,HARRY, I don’t seek it for myself!  You have to believe me!,8,male
5171,HARRY, I want to destroy it.,8,male
5172,HARRY," That’s what you want, isn’t it, Helena?  You want it destroyed.",8,male
5173,HARRY," I’ll end your pain, Helena.  Tell me where it is and I’ll destroy it, I swear, on my mother’s memory --",8,male
5174,HARRY, Tom Riddle --,8,male
5175,HARRY, He’s lied to many people --,8,male
5176,HARRY," Yes.  That’s right.  But I can undo that, Helena.  I can destroy it once and for all.  But only if you tell me where he hid it.  You know where he hid it, don’t you, Helena?  You just have to tell me. Please. Trust me.",8,male
5177,HARRY, Thank you,8,male
5178,HARRY, Thank you,8,male
5179,HARRY, Ginny!  Neville!  You alright?,8,male
5180,HARRY, Luna -- ?,8,male
5181,HARRY, I could ask you the same.,8,male
5182,HARRY, I remember.,8,male
5183,HARRY, What’s wrong with the one you have?,8,male
5184,HARRY, Why didn’t you tell her?,8,male
5185,HARRY, Bellatrix.  You knew it was me. But you didn’t say anything.,8,male
5186,HARRY, No.  I don’t think so...,8,male
5187,HARRY," Besides, its allegiance is to me now.  If you want it, you’ll have to win it back.  Perhaps even kill me...",8,male
5188,HARRY, Expelliarmus!,8,male
5189,HARRY, It’s gone!  We’ll never --,8,male
5190,HARRY, Well done.  Let’s find Ron and get out of here.,8,male
5191,HARRY, Split up!,8,male
5192,HARRY," No, it’ll just follow us!",8,male
5193,HARRY, Here!  Take one!,8,male
5194,HARRY, Wait!  What about Malfoy and Blaise!,8,male
5195,HARRY," Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul.",8,male
5196,HARRY, He does.,8,male
5197,HARRY, It’s the snake.  She’s the last one.  The last Horcrux.,8,male
5198,HARRY, No.  He’ll keep her close.,8,male
5199,HARRY, I know where he is.,8,male
5200,HARRY, Give me something!  Quickly!  A flask!  Anything.,8,male
5201,HARRY, I’m going there now.,8,male
5202,HARRY, It’s... meant to be.,8,male
5203,HARRY, There’s a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes.,8,male
5204,HARRY, I think I’ve known for awhile. I think you’ve known too.,8,male
5205,HARRY, Kill the snake.  Kill the snake and then it’s just him.  Then it will be over.,8,male
5206,HARRY, Once.  Twice.  Thrice...,8,male
5207,HARRY, Why are you here?  All of you?,8,male
5208,HARRY, Does it hurt?  Dying?,8,male
5209,HARRY," I’m sorry.  I didn’t want any of you to die for me.  And Remus, your son...",8,male
5210,HARRY, You’ll stay with me?,8,male
5211,HARRY, He won’t be able to see you?,8,male
5212,HARRY, Stay close to me.,8,male
5213,HARRY, You weren’t.,8,male
5214,HARRY," Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren’t you, sir?",8,male
5215,HARRY, Then... I’m dead too?,8,male
5216,HARRY, Not?,8,male
5217,HARRY, But I didn’t defend myself.  I let him kill me.,8,male
5218,HARRY," It’s true, isn’t it, sir?  A bit of him lives in me, doesn’t it?",8,male
5219,HARRY, And you knew this?  That’s why you were certain I wouldn’t die?,8,male
5220,HARRY," Professor, is that -- ?",8,male
5221,HARRY," Exactly where are we, sir?",8,male
5222,HARRY, It looks like King’s Cross station -- only a lot cleaner.  And without the trains.,8,male
5223,HARRY," Sir, why didn’t you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?",8,male
5224,HARRY, Sir --,8,male
5225,HARRY," You wanted to see Ariana again, didn’t you, sir?",8,male
5226,HARRY," I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest.  I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin...",8,male
5227,HARRY," I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?",8,male
5228,HARRY, I’ve got a choice?,8,male
5229,HARRY, And where would it take me?,8,male
5230,HARRY, Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.,8,male
5231,HARRY, And the snake lives.,8,male
5232,HARRY, And I’ve nothing to kill it with.,8,male
5233,HARRY," With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle.",8,male
5234,HARRY," Which would be, sir?",8,male
5235,HARRY," Sir, my mother’s Patronus.  It was a doe, wasn’t it?  Just like Professor Snape’s.  Curious, don’t you think?",8,male
5236,HARRY, Professor.,8,male
5237,HARRY, Is this real?  Or has this been happening inside my head?,8,male
5238,HARRY, Confringo!,8,male
5239,HARRY, The snake!  We’ve got to kill the snake!,8,male
5240,HARRY, Because I have something worth living for.,8,male
5241,HARRY, Confringo!,8,male
5242,HARRY, You were right.,8,male
5243,HARRY, When you told Professor Snape it was failing you.  It will always fail you.,8,male
5244,HARRY, But what if the wand never belonged to him?  What if the wand’s allegiance was to someone else?,8,male
5245,HARRY," Come on, Tom.  Let’s end this the way we started it...",8,male
5246,HARRY, Together.,8,male
5247,HARRY, I told you:  it’s useless to you.,8,male
5248,HARRY, Because it answers to another.,8,male
5249,HARRY," When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his.  But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape.",8,male
5250,HARRY," It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy Tower.  From that moment on, the wand answered to him. Until the other night... ... when I disarmed Draco.",8,male
5251,HARRY, It answers to me.,8,male
5252,HARRY," Well, it wasn’t boring, was it?",8,male
5358,DRACO, I can’t... I can’t be sure.,8,male
5359,DRACO, What’s wrong with his face?,8,male
5360,DRACO, Take my hand. Now.,8,male
5361,DRACO," Well, well, what brings you here, Potter?",8,male
5362,DRACO, I virtually lived here last year. Remember?,8,male
5363,DRACO, You have something of mine.  I’d like it back.,8,male
5364,DRACO," It’s my mother’s.  It’s very powerful, but it’s not the same. It doesn’t... understand me. Know what I mean?",8,male
5365,DRACO, Easy.,8,male
5366,DRACO, Give me my wand.,8,male
5367,DRACO, Potter!,8,male
5368,RON, Harry!  What’re we going to do? We can’t just leave Hermione alone with her!,8,male
5369,RON," We have to do something, Harry!",8,male
5370,RON, Let her go!  Let her go!,8,male
5371,RON, Works for me.,8,male
5372,RON, Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. Trust me.,8,male
5373,RON, Sss.,8,male
5374,RON, Like hell!,8,male
5375,RON, Expelliarmus!,8,male
5376,RON, All right!,8,male
5377,RON, Then you’re on our side.,8,male
5378,RON, Who put it there?  The fake.,8,male
5379,RON, And if we find one?  How’re we supposed to destroy it if we’ve given Griphook the sword?,8,male
5380,RON, You’re sure it’s hers?,8,male
5381,RON, You heard Ollivander.  It’s Harry’s now.,8,male
5382,RON," How will we know what it is when we get in there?  After all, a Horcrux can be anything.",8,male
5383,RON, That’s a bit scary.,8,male
5384,RON, What d’you think?,8,male
5385,RON, You want to tell me what that is?,8,male
5386,RON, You mean he could see you?,8,male
5387,RON, Go on.,8,male
5388,RON, Bloody hell... that’s a sight.,8,male
5389,RON, Hideous.,8,male
5390,RON," Couldn’t do anything about that bit in the back that’s always flipping up, could you?  Dead annoying --",8,male
5391,RON," Never mind.  I’m good. That is you in there, isn’t it?",8,male
5392,RON, Hey.  Easy.,8,male
5393,RON, What do you mean?,8,male
5394,RON," Harry, what do we do?  Harry...?",8,male
5395,RON, What’s that?  Up ahead.,8,male
5396,RON, You don’t say. Just out of interest... is there any other way out of here?,8,male
5397,RON, Imperio!,8,male
5398,RON, No.  It’s not possible...,8,male
5399,RON, Bloody hell.  That’s a Welsh Green.,8,male
5400,RON, It’s been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.,8,male
5401,RON, Blimey...,8,male
5402,RON," Is it here, Harry?  Can you feel anything?",8,male
5403,RON, Keep going!,8,male
5404,RON, The cup!,8,male
5405,RON, Foul little git.  Least we’ve got Bogrod.,8,male
5406,RON, That’s unfortunate.,8,male
5407,RON, You’re asking us?  You’re the brilliant one.,8,male
5408,RON, That’s your idea?,8,male
5409,RON, That was brilliant!  BRILLIANT!,8,male
5410,RON, Bloody hell.,8,male
5411,RON, I say we jump!,8,male
5412,RON, Never mind!  What did you see?,8,male
5413,RON, What happens when he finds out four are gone?,8,male
5414,RON, ‘Fraid he’s right.  One problem: Snape’s Headmaster now.  We can’t just walk in the front door.,8,male
5415,RON, Maybe it’s because of the Horcruxes.  Maybe he’s growing weaker.  Maybe he’s dying.,8,male
5416,RON, What’s he mean by that?,8,male
5417,RON, Did you get a look at him!  For a second I thought it was --,8,male
5418,RON, Who’s that with her?  Bloody hell...,8,male
5419,RON, I don’t remember this being on the Marauder’s Map.,8,male
5420,RON," Oh, bloody hell.  Here we go.",8,male
5421,RON, Excuse me.  But would someone tell me:  what’s a bloody diadem?,8,male
5422,RON," Six months she hasn’t seen me and it’s like I’m Frankie First Year. I mean, I’m only her brother.",8,male
5423,RON," Shut up, Seamus.",8,male
5424,RON," Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking.  It doesn’t really matter if we find the Horcrux.",8,male
5425,RON, So we were thinking --,8,male
5426,RON," You destroyed Tom Riddle’s Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don’t we?",8,male
5427,RON, Take me inside.,8,male
5428,RON, Harry talks in his sleep.  Haven’t you noticed?,8,male
5429,RON, I’ve never got this far before.,8,male
5430,RON, Me too.,8,male
5431,RON, What did you expect it to be like?,8,male
5432,RON, You do it.,8,male
5433,RON," Yes, you can.",8,male
5434,RON, Bloody hell.  We’ll never find him on this.,8,male
5435,RON, What?,8,male
5436,RON, Brilliant.,8,male
5437,RON," He must’ve gone into the Room of Requirement.  It doesn’t show on the map, remember?  You said so last year.",8,male
5438,RON, Let’s go.,8,male
5439,RON, RUN!  Goyle’s set the bloody place on fire!,8,male
5440,RON, Serves him right.,8,male
5441,RON," He’s joking, right?",8,male
5442,RON," IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!",8,male
5443,RON, Brilliant.,8,male
5444,RON, You’re bloody well welcome! Prat.,8,male
5445,RON, Where will he take her?,8,male
5446,RON," Look inside him, Harry.",8,male
5447,RON," Find out where he is.  If we find him, we find the snake.  Then we’re one step closer to ending this.",8,male
5448,RON, He’s gone.  The snake too.,8,male
5449,RON, Never!  Do you hear me!  NEVER!,8,male
5450,RON," We thought you’d gone to the forest, we thought you might be --",8,male
5451,RON, Are you mad!  No!,8,male
5452,RON, Rubbish!  You can’t just give yourself up to him --,8,male
5453,RON, Liar!,8,male
5454,RON, He saved your life.,8,male
5455,RON," Well done, Malfoy! Can’t believe I just said that.",8,male
5456,RON, Hermione!,8,male
5457,RON, I need to tell you something!,8,male
5458,RON," Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?",8,male
5459,RON, But that means...,8,male
5460,RON, What do you reckon we should do with it?,8,male
5461,RON," I’m just saying.  That’s the Elder Wand!  It’s the most powerful bloody wand in the world!  With that, we could, we could --",8,male
5489,OLLIVANDER, There’s no way out.  We’ve tried everything.,8,male
5490,OLLIVANDER, Forgive me if I don’t get up.,8,male
5491,OLLIVANDER," Anything, m’boy, anything.",8,male
5492,OLLIVANDER, Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding.  This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange.,8,male
5493,OLLIVANDER, Hawthorn.  Unicorn hair.  Ten inches.  Reasonably pliant.  This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.,8,male
5494,OLLIVANDER, Perhaps not -- if you won it from him.  I sense its allegiance has changed.,8,male
5495,OLLIVANDER," The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.  That much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.",8,male
5496,OLLIVANDER," There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess them all is to make oneself the Master of Death.  But few truly believe such objects exist --",8,male
5497,OLLIVANDER, I see no reason to put stock in an old wives tale --,8,male
5498,OLLIVANDER," He tortured me!  Besides, I conveyed only rumors.  There’s no guarantee he will find it --",8,male
5499,OLLIVANDER," He’s after you, Mr. Potter.  If it’s true, what you say, that he has the Elder Wand, I’m afraid you really don’t stand a chance.",8,male
5500,GRIPHOOK," I left Gringotts employ many weeks ago, but when I was last in your vault, the sword was there.",8,male
5501,GRIPHOOK," There is no place safer than Gringotts, Madam LeStrange.",8,male
5502,GRIPHOOK, Alive.,8,male
5503,GRIPHOOK," -- that I showed you to your vault the first time you visited Gringotts?  Even amongst goblins, you are famous, Harry Potter. You buried the elf.  I saw you.",8,male
5504,GRIPHOOK, And brought me here.,8,male
5505,GRIPHOOK, You are a very unusual wizard.,8,male
5506,GRIPHOOK, Soon the Death Eaters will control it.  That was unacceptable to me.,8,male
5507,GRIPHOOK, This is a wizard’s war.  I take no side.,8,male
5508,GRIPHOOK, It is impossible.,8,male
5509,GRIPHOOK, How did you come by this sword?,8,male
5510,GRIPHOOK, It’s complicated.,8,male
5511,GRIPHOOK," There is a sword in Madam Lestrange’s vault identical to this one, but it is a fake.  It was placed there this past summer.",8,male
5512,GRIPHOOK, The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.,8,male
5513,GRIPHOOK," It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to.  There are more than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts.",8,male
5514,GRIPHOOK, Perhaps.,8,male
5515,GRIPHOOK, I have no interest in gold.,8,male
5516,GRIPHOOK, That is my price.,8,male
5517,GRIPHOOK," I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of Gryffindor if I help you?",8,male
5518,GRIPHOOK," Good morning?  Good morning? You’re Bellatrix Lestrange, not some dewy-eyed schoolgirl!",8,male
5519,GRIPHOOK, She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our own throats.  Understand?,8,male
5520,GRIPHOOK, Time will tell.,8,male
5521,GRIPHOOK, I should have known --,8,male
5522,GRIPHOOK, The Thief’s Downfall.  Washes away all enchantments.  Can be deadly.,8,male
5523,GRIPHOOK, No.,8,male
5524,GRIPHOOK, We need him!,8,male
5525,GRIPHOOK, Well done.,8,male
5526,GRIPHOOK, Go on.,8,male
5527,GRIPHOOK, We’ll only have a few seconds.  In other words... they’ll be no do- overs.  Understood?,8,male
5528,GRIPHOOK," Ready, Bogrod?",8,male
5529,GRIPHOOK, They’ve added Gemino and Flagrante Curses!  Everything you touch will burn and multiply!,8,male
5530,GRIPHOOK, We’ll be crushed!  Hurry!,8,male
5531,GRIPHOOK, I said I’d get you in.  I never said anything about getting you out.,8,male
5532,GRIPHOOK, Thieves!  Help!  Thieves!,8,male
5543,VOLDEMORT," The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini.  We must find out just how much he knows.  We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe.",8,male
5544,VOLDEMORT," And you, my friend, must stay close...",8,male
5545,VOLDEMORT, They never learn.  Such a pity.,8,male
5546,VOLDEMORT, Begin.,8,male
5547,VOLDEMORT, Nagini.  Come.,8,male
5548,VOLDEMORT, Stop looking at her.  She smells your fear.  It agitates her.  Be grateful she’s just eaten.,8,male
5549,VOLDEMORT," I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will come to me!  Do you understand!",8,male
5550,VOLDEMORT," How do you live with yourself, Lucius? Go.  Find Severus.  Tell him I need to see him immediately.",8,male
5551,VOLDEMORT, Why doesn’t it work for me?,8,male
5552,VOLDEMORT, No!  I am extraordinary!  But the wand resists me!,8,male
5553,VOLDEMORT, Does it?,8,male
5554,VOLDEMORT, The wand.  Does it truly answer to me?,8,male
5555,VOLDEMORT," You’re a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know.",8,male
5556,VOLDEMORT," Where, Severus?  Where does its loyalty lie?",8,male
5557,VOLDEMORT," The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master.",8,male
5558,VOLDEMORT," You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus.",8,male
5559,VOLDEMORT, But only I can live forever...,8,male
5560,VOLDEMORT, Kill.,8,male
5561,VOLDEMORT, Nagini!  Come!,8,male
5562,VOLDEMORT," I thought he would come.  I was, it seems... mistaken.",8,male
5563,VOLDEMORT, Harry Potter.  The Boy Who Lived. Come to die.,8,male
5564,VOLDEMORT, I do not require assistance.,8,male
5565,VOLDEMORT," Behold, Nagini.  Our work is done.",8,male
5566,VOLDEMORT, SILENCE!,8,male
5567,VOLDEMORT, Stupid girl.  You cry for that?,8,male
5568,VOLDEMORT, Tell me.  These last few hours -- as you collected the dead and tended your wounded -- was he by your side?,8,male
5569,VOLDEMORT," While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only.  While you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees.  While you cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child’s.",8,male
5570,VOLDEMORT, So do not cry for that.  He’s not worthy of your tears.  And do not despair of his betrayal.  You were never in his heart.  Not for one single solitary beat.,8,male
5571,VOLDEMORT," Did you not hear me!  Harry Potter is dead!  From this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences.  HARRY POTTER IS DEAD!",8,male
5572,VOLDEMORT, Now is the time to declare yourself.,8,male
5573,VOLDEMORT," Well done, Draco.  Who will be next?  Hm?  Come now, don’t be shy.",8,male
5574,VOLDEMORT," Well, I must say, I’d hoped for better.  Is this truly the best Hogwarts has to offer?",8,male
5575,VOLDEMORT," Who might you be, young man?",8,male
5576,VOLDEMORT," Well, welcome, Neville.  I’m sure we can find a place for you in our ranks.",8,male
5577,VOLDEMORT," Now, now, Bellatrix.  Let’s not underestimate our young friend. By stepping forward, he lives to see another day...",8,male
5578,VOLDEMORT," Very well, Neville.  I’m sure we’d all be fascinated to hear what you have to say.",8,male
5579,VOLDEMORT, Nagini!  With me!,8,male
5580,VOLDEMORT, Leave her!,8,male
5581,VOLDEMORT, I said LEAVE HER!,8,male
5582,VOLDEMORT," Now, my sweet.  Now.",8,male
5583,VOLDEMORT, Nagini!,8,male
5584,VOLDEMORT, Die!  Die!,8,male
5585,VOLDEMORT, Why do you live!,8,male
5586,VOLDEMORT, It belongs to me!  I killed Snape!,8,male
5587,ABERFORTH," In here, Potter.",8,male
5588,ABERFORTH, You bloody fools!  What were you thinking coming here?  Do you have any idea how dangerous it is --,8,male
5589,ABERFORTH, Where’ve you left him?,8,male
5590,ABERFORTH, Sorry to hear it.  I liked that elf.,8,male
5591,ABERFORTH," Mundungus Fletcher, ‘bout a year ago.",8,male
5592,ABERFORTH, Sirius.  Albus told me.  He also told me that you’d likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it.  But ask yourself where you’d be if I didn’t.,8,male
5593,ABERFORTH," Right then.  Reckon you’re hungry. Let’s get you fed, then think of the best way to get you out of here.",8,male
5594,ABERFORTH, The Order is finished.  You-Know- Who’s won.  Anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves.,8,male
5595,ABERFORTH, Did he now?  Nice job?  Easy?,8,male
5596,ABERFORTH," It’s not a job my brother’s given you, it’s a suicide mission.  Do yourself a favor boy.  Go home. Live a little longer.",8,male
5597,ABERFORTH," What makes you think you can trust him!  What makes you think you can believe anything my brother told you!  In all the time you knew him, did he ever mention my name? Did he ever mention hers?",8,male
5598,ABERFORTH, Keep secrets?  You tell me.,8,male
5599,ABERFORTH, Did you now?  And why is that?,8,male
5600,ABERFORTH," That’s a boy’s answer.  A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the word of a man who won’t even tell him where to start.  You’re lying. Not just to me, which doesn’t matter, but to yourself as well. That’s what a fool does.",8,male
5601,ABERFORTH," You don’t strike me as a fool, Mr. Potter.  So I’ll ask you again. There must be a reason.  Why do you trust anything my brother ever said to you?  Why?",8,male
5602,ABERFORTH, You know what to do...,8,male
5603,ABERFORTH, You’ll see soon enough.,8,male
5604,ABERFORTH, She’ll always be beautiful.,8,male
5605,ABERFORTH," My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter, in his journey to find power, including her.  She was devoted to him -- he gave her everything, but time.",8,male
5606,NEVILLE, I knew you’d come!  I told them all!  Harry Potter would never abandon Hogwarts!,8,male
5607,NEVILLE, Like hell?  I reckon.  This is nothing.  Seamus is worse.  You’ll see.  Hermione!  Ron!,8,male
5608,NEVILLE," Hey, Ab.  There might be a couple more people on the way.",8,male
5609,NEVILLE, Well?  Ready?,8,male
5610,NEVILLE, That’s because it never existed till now.  The seven secret passages were sealed off before the start of the year.  This is the only way in or out now.  The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors.,8,male
5611,NEVILLE, Hardly ever see him.  It’s the Carrows you have to watch out for.,8,male
5612,NEVILLE," Brother and sister.  They’re in charge of discipline.  Like punishment, the Carrows.",8,male
5613,NEVILLE, Today’s Dark Arts lesson had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse. On First Years.  I refused. Hogwarts has changed.,8,male
5614,NEVILLE," Aw, c’mon.  Don’t be grim.  We’re all used to it by now.  And the thing is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope.  I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.  C’mon, we’re almost there.",8,male
5615,NEVILLE," Let’s have a bit of fun, shall we? Hey!  Listen up, you lot!  I’ve brought you a surprise!",8,male
5616,NEVILLE, Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry’s back.,8,male
5617,NEVILLE," Okay, okay!  Stand down!  Let’s not kill them before You-Know-Who gets the chance! Right then.  What’s the plan, Harry?",8,male
5618,NEVILLE, What is it?,8,male
5619,NEVILLE," What is it, Ginny?",8,male
5620,NEVILLE," Let me get this straight, Professor.  You’re giving us permission to do this?",8,male
5621,NEVILLE, To blow it up.  Boom.,8,male
5622,NEVILLE," Wicked. Um... exactly how do you propose we do this, Professor?",8,male
5623,NEVILLE," You do know what you’re doing, don’t you, Seamus?",8,male
5624,NEVILLE, Blimey.,8,male
5625,NEVILLE, Not good.,8,male
5626,NEVILLE, Ha!  Ha!,8,male
5627,NEVILLE, Yeah!  You and whose army!,8,male
5628,NEVILLE, Sorry. Ow.,8,male
5629,NEVILLE, Not good.,8,male
5630,NEVILLE, Are you bloody joking?!,8,male
5631,NEVILLE, Oh God --,8,male
5632,NEVILLE," Well done, Seamus!",8,male
5633,NEVILLE, That was kind of exciting.,8,male
5634,NEVILLE, Not good.,8,male
5635,NEVILLE," Never better!  Feel like I could spit fire!  Haven’t seen Luna, have you?",8,male
5636,NEVILLE," I’m mad for her!  Think it’s about time I told her, seeing as there’s a pretty good chance we’ll both be dead by dawn!",8,male
5637,NEVILLE, Don’t mention it.,8,male
5638,NEVILLE, Neville Longbottom.,8,male
5639,NEVILLE, I’d like to say something.,8,male
5640,NEVILLE, It doesn’t matter that Harry is gone.,8,male
5641,NEVILLE," People die every day.  Friends. Family.  Yes, we lost Harry tonight.  But he’s still with us, here -- And so is Fred and Remus and Tonks and... all of them.  They didn’t die in vain. But you will. And you and you and you will. And so will you.  Because you’re wrong.  Harry’s heart did beat for us.  All of us...",8,male
5642,NEVILLE, This isn’t over.,8,male
5643,NEVILLE, Harry!  Look out!,8,male
5655,SNAPE, Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this hour.  It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.,8,male
5656,SNAPE, I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by rumor.,8,male
5657,SNAPE, Now then.  If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter’s movements this evening... I invite them to step forward now.,8,male
5658,SNAPE," You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord.  In the last few hours alone --",8,male
5659,SNAPE," There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure.  It answers to you and you only.",8,male
5660,SNAPE, My Lord?,8,male
5661,SNAPE," With you, of course, my Lord.",8,male
5662,SNAPE, My Lord --,8,male
5663,SNAPE, Take them...,8,male
5664,SNAPE, Take them!,8,male
5665,SNAPE, Please.,8,male
5666,SNAPE, They are the same...,8,male
5667,SNAPE, You have your mother’s eyes...,8,male
5668,SNAPE, No!  Don’t kill me!,8,male
5669,SNAPE, None.  I come on my own account. I come with a... request.,8,male
5670,SNAPE, Yes.,8,male
5671,SNAPE, Only what I heard.  But now... he thinks it refers to her.,8,male
5672,SNAPE, Yes!  But he thinks it’s her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To kill them!,8,male
5673,SNAPE, I have asked.,8,male
5674,SNAPE, She’s more than that!  She’s different!  Beautiful.  Kind. Hide them all.  I beg you.,8,male
5675,SNAPE, Anything.,8,male
5676,SNAPE, You said you would keep her safe!,8,male
5677,SNAPE, DON’T!,8,male
5678,SNAPE, He doesn’t need protection.  The Dark Lord has gone --,8,male
5679,SNAPE, No one can know.  Your word.,8,male
5680,SNAPE, He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his father’s.  And he seems to relish his fame.,8,male
5681,SNAPE, You see what you want to see.,8,male
5682,SNAPE, Why did you put it on?  Surely you realized it carried a curse.,8,male
5683,SNAPE, Drink the rest.  It will contain the curse to the hand for the time being.,8,male
5684,SNAPE, It will spread.,8,male
5685,SNAPE, Maybe a year.,8,male
5686,SNAPE, It is not expected that he will succeed.,8,male
5687,SNAPE, You ask too much.,8,male
5688,SNAPE, Tell him what?,8,male
5689,SNAPE," So when the time comes, the boy must die.",8,male
5690,SNAPE, You’ve kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You’ve been raising him like a pig for slaughter.,8,male
5691,SNAPE, Expecto Patronum!,8,male
5692,SNAPE, Always...,8,male
5725,DUMBLEDORE, That wasn’t my intention.,8,male
5726,DUMBLEDORE," Stand up, Severus.  I haven’t much time.  What message do you bring from Lord Voldemort this time?",8,male
5727,DUMBLEDORE, Is this about the Prophecy?,8,male
5728,DUMBLEDORE, How much did you relay?,8,male
5729,DUMBLEDORE, The Prophecy did not refer to a woman.  It spoke of a boy born at the end of July --,8,male
5730,DUMBLEDORE," If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy.",8,male
5731,DUMBLEDORE, You disgust me.  You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush?,8,male
5732,DUMBLEDORE," And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?",8,male
5733,DUMBLEDORE," Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person.  Rather like you, Severus.",8,male
5734,DUMBLEDORE, The boy survives.,8,male
5735,DUMBLEDORE, He has her eyes.,8,male
5736,DUMBLEDORE," If you loved Lily Evans, Severus. If you truly loved her.  Then your way is clear.",8,male
5737,DUMBLEDORE, The Dark Lord will return.  And the boy will be in terrible danger when he does.,8,male
5738,DUMBLEDORE," My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus?  If you insist.",8,male
5739,DUMBLEDORE," Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus.  Other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging.",8,male
5740,DUMBLEDORE," Perhaps.  Oh.  Severus. Keep an eye on Professor Quirrell, won’t you?",8,male
5741,DUMBLEDORE, I was... foolish... greedy...,8,male
5742,DUMBLEDORE, For the time being?,8,male
5743,DUMBLEDORE, How long?,8,male
5744,DUMBLEDORE," Well, this makes matters much more straightforward.",8,male
5745,DUMBLEDORE," Do not ignore me, Severus.  Was it not you who told me of Lord Voldemort’s plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me?",8,male
5746,DUMBLEDORE," But should he fail, one would presume the Dark Lord will turn to... you.",8,male
5747,DUMBLEDORE, You must agree.,8,male
5748,DUMBLEDORE," Yes.  You must be the one to kill me, Severus.  It is the only way. Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely.",8,male
5749,DUMBLEDORE, Too much!  Nothing I could ask is too much.  You know what is at stake!  You more than anyone!,8,male
5750,DUMBLEDORE, There will come a time when Harry Potter must be told something. But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.,8,male
5751,DUMBLEDORE," On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric’s Hollow to kill Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that happened, a part of Lord Voldemort’s soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find:  Harry himself.",8,male
5752,DUMBLEDORE, There’s a reason Harry can speak with snakes.  There’s a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort’s mind.  A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him.,8,male
5753,DUMBLEDORE, Yes.  And Voldemort himself must do it.  That is essential.,8,male
5754,DUMBLEDORE," But this is touching, Severus. Don’t tell me you’ve grown to care for the boy?",8,male
5755,DUMBLEDORE, Lily.  After all this time?,8,male
5756,DUMBLEDORE, You cannot help.,8,male
5757,DUMBLEDORE," Harry.  You wonderful boy.  You brave, brave man.  Let us walk.",8,male
5758,DUMBLEDORE," Oh, yes.",8,male
5759,DUMBLEDORE," Ah.  That is the question, isn’t it?  On the whole I think not.",8,male
5760,DUMBLEDORE, Not.,8,male
5761,DUMBLEDORE," And that will, I think, have made all the difference.  I suspect you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than fate since that night in Godric’s Hollow all those years ago, Harry.",8,male
5762,DUMBLEDORE, Did.  It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than Voldemort himself.,8,male
5763,DUMBLEDORE," You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant to make.",8,male
5764,DUMBLEDORE," Certain?  No.  Little is certain in this world, Harry.  Call it an educated guess.",8,male
5765,DUMBLEDORE, Something beyond either of our help.,8,male
5766,DUMBLEDORE, I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are?,8,male
5767,DUMBLEDORE," King’s Cross!  Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your party.",8,male
5768,DUMBLEDORE," You will have to forgive me, Harry.  You see... I didn’t trust you.",8,male
5769,DUMBLEDORE," I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor.  But I crave your pardon, Harry.  It’s clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man.",8,male
5770,DUMBLEDORE," You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me.  I was fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to save others from it.  But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that I paid with my life.",8,male
5771,DUMBLEDORE, Yes.,8,male
5772,DUMBLEDORE, True.  But ask yourself this: were you calling them?  Or were they calling you?,8,male
5773,DUMBLEDORE," You are the true master of death, Harry, because the true master does not seek to run away from death.  He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world.",8,male
5774,DUMBLEDORE, That is up to you.,8,male
5775,DUMBLEDORE," Oh yes.  We are in King’s Cross, you say?  I think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let’s say, board a train.",8,male
5776,DUMBLEDORE, On.,8,male
5777,DUMBLEDORE, True.,8,male
5778,DUMBLEDORE, Yes.,8,male
5779,DUMBLEDORE, ‘Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.’,8,male
5780,DUMBLEDORE," I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic, capable both of inflicting injury and remedying it.  But I would -- in this case -- amend my original statement to this: Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who most deserve it... Assuming circumstances in the main are favorable to such an outcome, of course.",8,male
5781,DUMBLEDORE," I’ve never put much stock in miracles, Harry.  On the other hand, I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon.",8,male
5782,DUMBLEDORE, Luck.,8,male
5783,DUMBLEDORE," Do not pity the dead, Harry.  Pity the living and, above all, those who live without love.",8,male
5784,DUMBLEDORE," Actually, if I think about it... it doesn’t seem curious at all. I’ll be going now, Harry.",8,male
5785,DUMBLEDORE," Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry.  But why should that mean that it is not real?",8,male
973,DOBBY, Harry Potter!  Such an honor it is!,2,male organism
974,DOBBY," Dobby, sir.  Dobby the house elf.",2,male organism
975,DOBBY," Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands. It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you... it is difficult, sir... Dobby wonders where to begin.",2,male organism
976,DOBBY, S-s-sit down?,2,male organism
977,DOBBY," Offend Dobby!  Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal...",2,male organism
