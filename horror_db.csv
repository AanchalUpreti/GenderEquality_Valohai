1226,AMY,So it is real?,2,female
1227,AMY,I don’t understand.,2,female
1228,AMY,But what is it all for?,2,female
1229,AMY,Me.,2,female
1230,AMY,Leave her alone!,2,female
1231,AMY,I can’t.,2,female
1232,AMY,I can’t.,2,female
1233,AMY,I don’t think so.,2,female
1234,AMY,I didn’t want any of this. They used me,2,female
1235,AMY,to open the box. I didn’t choose to do,2,female
1236,AMY,anything.,2,female
1237,AMY,Please.,2,female
1238,AMY,I didn’t mean to. I only wanted the,2,female
1239,AMY,truth.,2,female
1240,AMY,What about them?,2,female
1241,AMY,I didn’t give my soul to him...,2,female
1242,AMY,...and I’m not giving it to you.,2,female
1243,CHARLES,"Ah, I detect that unique and ubiquitous",2,male
1244,CHARLES,combination of female sweat and patchouli,2,male
1245,CHARLES,oil that signals the arrival of...,2,male
1246,CHARLES,...the delightful and world-famous Amy,2,male
1247,CHARLES,"Klein. Have a seat, angel of light.",2,male
1248,CHARLES,It’s exactly that lack of respect for,2,male
1249,CHARLES,authority that got you fired from the New,2,male
1250,CHARLES,York Post.,2,male
1251,CHARLES,Of course. Where would you be without me?,2,male
1252,CHARLES,"By the way, I don’t recall ever being",2,male
1253,CHARLES,thanked properly for this “re-,2,male
1254,CHARLES,assignment”.,2,male
1255,CHARLES,"Touche’. Well, thanks to international",2,male
1256,CHARLES,"conglomerates and the Euro-dollar I,",2,male
1257,CHARLES,"along with Mother England, am blessed",2,male
1258,CHARLES,"with your acquaintance, yet again.",2,male
1259,CHARLES,"It’s not about the crack whores, I’m sure",2,male
1260,CHARLES,you’re working your usual unrestrained,2,male
1261,CHARLES,insightful magic on what I’m certain will,2,male
1262,CHARLES,be another eye-opening expose. I expect,2,male
1263,CHARLES,nothing but brilliance -- in five,2,male
1264,CHARLES,thousand words or less.,2,male
1265,CHARLES,But this is better.,2,male
1266,CHARLES,Hmm? Oh no.,2,male
1267,CHARLES,Please feel free to have some of that.,2,male
1268,CHARLES,Spare me the “Nothing comes close to New,2,male
1269,CHARLES,York Chinese” speech just this once. Go,2,male
1270,CHARLES,"on, sit down. Just something I wanted to",2,male
1271,CHARLES,show you...,2,male
1272,CHARLES,"Okay... rewind, rewind? Rewind.",2,male
1273,CHARLES,Somebody mailed us this thing around two,2,male
1274,CHARLES,"weeks ago but, in keeping with our usual",2,male
1275,CHARLES,"level of efficiency, Betty didn’t get",2,male
1276,CHARLES,around to opening it ‘til this morning.,2,male
1277,CHARLES,Then she brought it to me.,2,male
1278,CHARLES,"Something.  Amy, with your encyclopedic",2,male
1279,CHARLES,world-wide knowledge of skank-ology --,2,male
1280,CHARLES,have you ever heard of “Deaders?”,2,male
1281,CHARLES,Not dead-heads...,2,male
1282,CHARLES,Dead - ers. D-E-A-D-E-R -- S.,2,male
1283,CHARLES,"Love of my life, go screw yourself. I’m",2,male
1284,CHARLES,asking you a serious question.,2,male
1285,CHARLES,Watch the tape.,2,male
1286,CHARLES,Just keep watching.,2,male
1287,CHARLES,Just watch...,2,male
1288,CHARLES,"I said, “Just watch.”",2,male
1289,CHARLES,You tell me.,2,male
1290,CHARLES,"That’s saying a lot, for you.",2,male
1291,CHARLES,That’s what I said.,2,male
1292,CHARLES,"I haven’t done anything. I told you, I",2,male
1293,CHARLES,just looked at it today. By some chance,2,male
1294,CHARLES,are you... interested in pursuing this?,2,male
1295,CHARLES,"Look, Amy. Maybe this is just some kind",2,male
1296,CHARLES,of bull-shit shot-on-tape gore movie. And,2,male
1297,CHARLES,"since that’s all it can be, that’s all",2,male
1298,CHARLES,"you’re going find, but it sure smells",2,male
1299,CHARLES,"different to me. If it’s bull-shit,",2,male
1300,CHARLES,you’ll know pretty fast. If it’s not...,2,male
1301,CHARLES,Who said miracles can only happen at,2,male
1302,CHARLES,Lourdes?,2,male
1303,CHARLES,Amy... you know what my father said,2,male
1304,CHARLES,once...,2,male
1305,CHARLES,"No, that was a different time. This time,",2,male
1306,CHARLES,we were driving down the block and there,2,male
1307,CHARLES,"was this fortune-telling place, you know,",2,male
1308,CHARLES,this gypsy fortune telling place in a,2,male
1309,CHARLES,"store front? And he said, “You know, if I",2,male
1310,CHARLES,could tell the future I wouldn’t be,2,male
1311,CHARLES,living in any crappy store front.”,2,male
1312,CHARLES,"If I could do that, I wouldn’t be hanging",2,male
1313,CHARLES,out in some rundown basement. I’d own the,2,male
1314,CHARLES,earth.,2,male
1315,CHARLES,Maybe.,2,male
1316,CHARLES,Just a return address on the envelope.,2,male
1317,CHARLES,Looks like your online fan-base is,2,male
1318,CHARLES,growing. It’s an address in Bucharest.,2,male
1319,CHARLES,It’s where all the Euro-trash kids,2,male
1320,CHARLES,looking for a good time are heading these,2,male
1321,CHARLES,days. Amsterdam is so 90’s.,2,male
1322,CHARLES,I still like to keep my finger on the,2,male
1323,CHARLES,"pulse, even though I know you think I",2,male
1324,CHARLES,don’t have one.,2,male
1325,CHARLES,"Your ticket, hotel and per diem.",2,male
1326,CHARLES,It’s what keeps me up at night.,2,male
1327,CHARLES,Now here’s the part where I’m supposed to,2,male
1328,CHARLES,say be careful. Be careful.,2,male
1329,CHARLES,Call me when you get settled.,2,male
1330,CHARLES,Don’t tell me I woke you up. I won’t,2,male
1331,CHARLES,believe that.,2,male
1332,CHARLES,You were supposed to call me.,2,male
1333,CHARLES,The thing is... I started thinking.,2,male
1334,CHARLES,Look. I know the crazy stuff you do for a,2,male
1335,CHARLES,story.,2,male
1336,CHARLES,And that’s why I hired you. It’s just.,2,male
1337,CHARLES,"Just... the thing is, Amy... some things",2,male
1338,CHARLES,"you shouldn’t do, you know what I mean?",2,male
1339,CHARLES,"Look, I say this to you, but in my heart",2,male
1340,CHARLES,I know that one time it’s going to,2,male
1341,CHARLES,"happen... that you’re going to end up, I",2,male
1342,CHARLES,don’t know -- dead or god knows what. But,2,male
1343,CHARLES,"when it does happen, I don’t want it to",2,male
1344,CHARLES,be my fault.,2,male
1345,CHARLES,"You know, you’re messing with my",2,male
1346,CHARLES,"conscience, here. Amy...",2,male
1347,CHARLES,"Christ, you’re lucky to have a boss like",2,male
1348,CHARLES,"me. Once again, I have saved your small",2,male
1349,CHARLES,but relatively shapely behind.,2,male
1350,CHARLES,Charge you? They were thinking of,2,male
1351,CHARLES,shipping you to the government asylum for,2,male
1352,CHARLES,observation -- and believe me if you go,2,male
1353,CHARLES,"in there, you don’t come out. But through",2,male
1354,CHARLES,my mastery of international negotiations,2,male
1355,CHARLES,I managed to convince them that you were,2,male
1356,CHARLES,merely irresponsible. You got your stuff?,2,male
1357,CHARLES,Come on.,2,male
1358,CHARLES,Who else would have taken it? Either,2,male
1359,CHARLES,"they’re going to think it’s bull-shit, or",2,male
1360,CHARLES,they’re going to be too afraid of it. But,2,male
1361,CHARLES,Amy Klein... Tell me it’s real Amy.,2,male
1362,CHARLES,"Well, either way, it’s a good story.",2,male
1363,CHARLES,"You know, Amy dearest, for the average",2,male
1364,CHARLES,"person, hunger for knowledge is like",2,male
1365,CHARLES,hunger... for food. We want to know just,2,male
1366,CHARLES,enough to take the edge off our appetite.,2,male
1367,CHARLES,"Then we’re satisfied, and we stop. But",2,male
1368,CHARLES,you... you’re like a glutton. You can’t,2,male
1369,CHARLES,help over-eating.,2,male
1370,CHARLES,"But you see, that’s the point. That’s why",2,male
1371,CHARLES,I need you. Because all that stuff I,2,male
1372,CHARLES,don’t eat... I still want. So I send you,2,male
1373,CHARLES,"in to do the eating for me, and so I get",2,male
1374,CHARLES,"to experience it, without actually",2,male
1375,CHARLES,suffering any mental indigestion.,2,male
1376,CHARLES,Nobody’s forcing anything down your,2,male
1377,CHARLES,throat. Correct?,2,male
1378,CHARLES,"You see, Amy, you never grew up with all",2,male
1379,CHARLES,this Catholic god and guilt stuff. It,2,male
1380,CHARLES,doesn’t mean anything to you. I worry,2,male
1381,CHARLES,about god and heaven and hell. Not during,2,male
1382,CHARLES,"the day, you understand, but around three",2,male
1383,CHARLES,"in the morning, it keeps me up. I want to",2,male
1384,CHARLES,know what’s coming. What’s up in heaven,2,male
1385,CHARLES,"and down in hell, or even if there’s",2,male
1386,CHARLES,"nothing. It’s useful, when you’re making",2,male
1387,CHARLES,plans. So go find out and we’ll tell the,2,male
1388,CHARLES,world.,2,male
1389,CHARLES,"Did you know, the word “demon” comes from",2,male
1390,CHARLES,the Greek word for “knowledge.” As in,2,male
1391,CHARLES,“demonstrate.”,2,male
1392,CHARLES,American education.,2,male
1393,CHARLES,"Then back to your room, lie down in your",2,male
1394,CHARLES,coffin until the hours of daylight have,2,male
1395,CHARLES,"passed, as is your wont -- then go get me",2,male
1396,CHARLES,my story.,2,male
1397,CHARLES,I never do. I’m not here to save people,2,male
1398,CHARLES,and I’m not here to judge them. I just,2,male
1399,CHARLES,take ‘em as they come. And use them as,2,male
1400,CHARLES,they pass by. I’ll be at the Soffitel.,2,male
1401,CHARLES,"Amy it’s Charles, I know it’s not too",2,male
1402,CHARLES,late.,2,male
1403,CHARLES,"Guilty. Look, Amy, I’ve been thinking",2,male
1404,CHARLES,"about the story about what happened,",2,male
1405,CHARLES,maybe this isn’t for you.,2,male
1406,CHARLES,- she said with condescension-,2,male
1407,CHARLES,"I think it’s too dangerous, for a lot of",2,male
1408,CHARLES,reasons.,2,male
1409,CHARLES,I know. I’m going to hate myself in the,2,male
1410,CHARLES,morning.,2,male
1411,CHARLES,OK. I just thought I’d put it out there,2,male
1412,CHARLES,to see if you’d bite. I should’ve known,2,male
1413,CHARLES,better.  It goes against my instincts.,2,male
1414,CHARLES,Yes I believe I’ve heard that somewhere,2,male
1415,CHARLES,before.,2,male
1416,CHARLES,Good morning.,2,male
1417,CHARLES,"Amy don’t fight it, it’s only going to",2,male
1418,CHARLES,make things worse.,2,male
1419,CHARLES,I didn’t hear from you. I went over to,2,male
1420,CHARLES,your hotel. You were lying on the,2,male
1421,CHARLES,floor... covered in every kind of stuff,2,male
1422,CHARLES,that can come out of a human body...,2,male
1423,CHARLES,Okay. Every other kind.,2,male
1424,CHARLES,You were sort of... having a psychotic,2,male
1425,CHARLES,"episode, sweets. Major mental blow-out.",2,male
1426,CHARLES,"And frankly, it’s about time. Jesus you",2,male
1427,CHARLES,were tied down for a day and half.,2,male
1428,CHARLES,"Listen, I’m trying to get you out of",2,male
1429,CHARLES,"here, back to London, but with the damage",2,male
1430,CHARLES,to your hotel room... They’re not going,2,male
1431,CHARLES,to be so quick to let you go.,2,male
1432,CHARLES,"Look, Amy, you probably won’t have to",2,male
1433,CHARLES,stay...,2,male
1434,CHARLES,"Well, there you go. A whole new",2,male
1435,CHARLES,definition of optimism.,2,male
1436,CHARLES,They found her dead in her room. She hung,2,male
1437,CHARLES,herself.,2,male
1438,CHARLES,Yeah. She’d been there awhile. Probably,2,male
1439,CHARLES,did it right after she sent us the tape.,2,male
1440,CHARLES,"Jesus, I don’t know. Does it matter?",2,male
1441,CHARLES,"But this is a good story too. Call it,",2,male
1442,CHARLES,"“My Psychotic Episode” -- or, wait, maybe",2,male
1443,CHARLES,“Psychotic - Episode One.” Or “Psychotic,2,male

1445,CHARLES,words with episode.,2,male
1446,CHARLES,"Look, there’s a lot of raw material",2,male
1447,CHARLES,around here. Emphasis on the word “raw.”,2,male
1448,CHARLES,Maybe they’ll let you use a felt-tip pen,2,male
1449,CHARLES,or something to take notes.,2,male
1450,CHARLES,What’s say we lose the charm bracelets,2,male
1451,CHARLES,for now?,2,male
1452,CHARLES,Unless of course you somehow find all of,2,male
1453,CHARLES,this -- stimulating.,2,male

1456,CHARLES,Feel better.,2,male
1457,CHARLES,"When you get a chance, check out the",2,male

1463,CHARLES,know.,2,male
1464,CHARLES,"Too bad, too. It would have made a hell",2,male
1465,CHARLES,of a story. (beat),2,male
1466,CHARLES,I’m sure she’ll come walking in here any,2,male
1467,CHARLES,"minute, carrying with her my story.",2,male
1468,CHARLES,"It’s a hell of a story, too. It just gets",2,male
1469,CHARLES,better and better. And it looks like I,2,male
1470,CHARLES,just may need somebody else crazy enough,2,male
1471,CHARLES,to go get it.,2,male
1472,MARLA,"Okay, okay. Here we go. There’s Anna...",2,female
1473,MARLA,"Here’s Marla Chen, official Deader",2,female

1475,MARLA,And here’s the star of the show. Katya...,2,female
1476,MARLA,And here’s our deader bed -- this is the,2,female
1477,MARLA,scene of the crime. Crime to be...,2,female
1478,MARLA,And here is the fearless leader of the,2,female
1479,MARLA,Deaders... Winter.,2,female
1480,MARLA,Stop her!,2,female
1481,MARLA,I knew you’d come. Course if you’re,2,female
1482,MARLA,"watching this tape, it’s already too late",2,female
1483,MARLA,for me. But maybe you can stop it.,2,female
1484,MARLA,He promised us pleasures beyond anything,2,female
1485,MARLA,we could ever imagine. We just had to,2,female
1486,MARLA,fight through the pain first. Easier said,2,female
1487,MARLA,than done.,2,female
1488,MARLA,Don’t open the box Amy. If you do Winter,2,female
1489,MARLA,"wins, and if he wins-",2,female
1490,MARLA,Go to Pletkow station at midnight. Go to,2,female
1491,MARLA,the south end of the platform and step,2,female
1492,MARLA,onto the last car. Find a guy named Joey,2,female
1493,MARLA,who runs the show and tell him I sent,2,female
1494,MARLA,you. He’ll guide you to them.,2,female
1495,MARLA,Save them Amy. Please...,2,female
1496,MARLA,Those you trust the most -- trust the,2,female
1497,MARLA,least.,2,female
1498,MARLA,Don’t open...,2,female
1499,MARLA,Only he can bring you back.,2,female
1500,MARLA,We have to go...,2,female
1501,MARLA,I didn’t have any other choice.,2,female
1502,MARLA,You’re dying.,2,female
1503,MARLA,Like me.,2,female
1504,MARLA,Please. We’ve got to go!,2,female
1505,MARLA,That’s for you to decide.,2,female
1506,MARLA,"You see, that’s the problem right there.",2,female
1507,MARLA,I’m supposed to help you. Like... Like,2,female
1508,MARLA,Winter helped me. But I don’t know if I,2,female
1509,MARLA,can.,2,female
1510,MARLA,To try... Because I have no other choice.,2,female
1511,MARLA,No turning back now-,2,female
1512,MARLA,Know what I mean?,2,female
1513,MARLA,Then let’s go home.,2,female
1514,MARLA,I put my head through a noose and I,2,female
1515,MARLA,"jumped ten feet down. They cut me down,",2,female
1516,MARLA,"and Winter breathed into me, and I was",2,female
1517,MARLA,alive. And everybody was happy... and,2,female
1518,MARLA,"like, congratulating me...",2,female
1519,MARLA,"And for a while, it was great. But it’s",2,female
1520,MARLA,like being a tightrope walker... you’re,2,female
1521,MARLA,"walking along on this rope, and then all",2,female
1522,MARLA,"of a sudden, it’s like you realize -- I’m",2,female
1523,MARLA,walking on a  rope a hundred feet up in,2,female
1524,MARLA,the air. And that’s when you fall.,2,female
1525,MARLA,I tried to end it. That’s when you found,2,female
1526,MARLA,me.,2,female
1527,MARLA,For the reward from it all.,2,female
1528,MARLA,But it isn’t enough for somebody else to,2,female
1529,MARLA,stick a knife into you. You have to come,2,female
1530,MARLA,to the point where you can do it to,2,female
1531,MARLA,yourself -- that’s the acceptance. The,2,female
1532,MARLA,final preparation before you give your,2,female
1533,MARLA,soul to it. Willingly.,2,female
1534,MARLA,That’s the missing link. That part he,2,female
1535,MARLA,keeps to himself. But he promises an,2,female
1536,MARLA,eternal paradise filled with the ultimate,2,female
1537,MARLA,pleasures. We just can’t be afraid. And,2,female
1538,MARLA,we can’t have any doubts.,2,female
1539,MARLA,Guess I screwed up on that part.,2,female
1540,MARLA,Fear is where you go to learn.,2,female
1541,MARLA,Sorry. I told you there’s no turning back,2,female
1542,MARLA,Amy. Only he can bring you back.,2,female
1543,MARLA,You say that like it’s a good thing.,2,female
1544,MARLA,You know he’s watching us.,2,female
1545,MARLA,Winter. This is where he sends all the,2,female
1546,MARLA,trouble makers. Tries to show us who’s,2,female
1547,MARLA,boss. Tries to make us believe.,2,female
1548,MARLA,As real as you want it to be. We all have,2,female
1549,MARLA,"our own version of the truth, some are",2,female
1550,MARLA,just more screwed up than others. But you,2,female
1551,MARLA,"wouldn’t know that, because you still",2,female
1552,MARLA,don’t know the truth.,2,female
1553,MARLA,You will. You see that’s the point. All,2,female
1554,MARLA,"this, “Deaders”, “Cenobites”, whatever",2,female
1555,MARLA,"you want to call it, it’s all about",2,female
1556,MARLA,solving the puzzle. Part of that puzzle,2,female
1557,MARLA,is you. Finding the secrets that are,2,female
1558,MARLA,hidden within you.,2,female
1559,MARLA,"- in there. And as soon as you find that,",2,female
1560,MARLA,"as soon as you face it, you’ll be free.",2,female
1561,MARLA,Once and for all.,2,female
1562,MARLA,"Ultimate pleasure -- more than anyone,",2,female
1563,MARLA,even those who have solved the puzzle,2,female
1564,MARLA,"before us, have ever known. Conditions of",2,female
1565,MARLA,the nerve endings the likes of which your,2,female
1566,MARLA,imagination could not hope to evoke.,2,female
1567,MARLA,...at Least that’s what they say.,2,female
1568,MARLA,Problem is Winter can’t solve the puzzle.,2,female
1569,MARLA,Only a few chosen ones -- with just the,2,female
1570,MARLA,right amount of depravity and loneliness,2,female
1571,MARLA,in their soul -- can.,2,female
1572,MARLA,"So he’s been on this quest for years,",2,female
1573,MARLA,searching for that mythical person who is,2,female
1574,MARLA,both willing to join us and can also,2,female
1575,MARLA,"solve the puzzle. And it would seem, Amy",2,female
1576,MARLA,"Klein, that that person is-",2,female
1577,MARLA,Bingo baby. Sorry.,2,female
1578,MARLA,He has to be there for you Amy. And he,2,female
1579,MARLA,will be. Like he was for all of us.,2,female
1580,MARLA,"That’s the key. Without him, you can’t",2,female
1581,MARLA,come back. It’s you he wants. Its you he,2,female
1582,MARLA,needs. Remember that above all.,2,female
1583,MARLA,Looks like you’re running out of time.,2,female
1584,MARLA,You’re here to stop this Amy. He needs,2,female
1585,MARLA,your soul willingly. Don’t let him take,2,female
1586,MARLA,you. Don’t go willingly.,2,female
1587,MARLA,Its over. Winter is gone. You can’t come,2,female
1588,MARLA,back. You won’t become a Deader...or one,2,female

2030,TIM,adults have less accurate memories,3,male

2354,KAYLIE,"saw, through the window.",3,female
2355,KAYLIE,The first time? We were playing in,3,female

2358,KAYLIE,No -,3,female
2359,KAYLIE,Stop it.,3,female
2360,KAYLIE,"Yeah, a bad marriage! That explains",3,female

2365,KAYLIE,last night in the house!,3,female
2366,KAYLIE,I had access to all of mom and,3,female

2375,KAYLIE,"ever made, every meal charged to",3,female

2377,KAYLIE,"woman, she was a ghost. I agree he",3,female
2378,KAYLIE,"was withdrawn, secretive,",3,female
2379,KAYLIE,"suspicious - sure, all signs of an",3,female
2380,KAYLIE,"affair, fine - I’m not saying he",3,female
2381,KAYLIE,"wasn’t seduced, it’s just a matter",3,female
2382,KAYLIE,of what seduced him.,3,female
2383,KAYLIE,Static?,3,female
2384,KAYLIE,"Oh, they did a bang up job on you",3,female
2385,KAYLIE,in there. You were perfectly normal,3,female

2393,KAYLIE,"Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!",3,female
2394,KAYLIE,These events transpired no more,3,female

2399,KAYLIE,Is that correct?,3,female
2400,KAYLIE,"Incidentally, the temperature in",3,female

2411,KAYLIE,Must’ve gotten more from the dog,3,female
2412,KAYLIE,than I guessed. Its radius of,3,female
2413,KAYLIE,influence appears to be ... 20,3,female

2415,KAYLIE,"to go in the kitchen, laundry room,",3,female
2416,KAYLIE,garage. The smaller upstairs,3,female

2419,KAYLIE,"If you want to make your call, I’d",3,female

2424,KAYLIE,"You can go. But think about it,",3,female
2425,KAYLIE,there’s no way I could’ve staged,3,female
2426,KAYLIE,this. Something else is happening,3,female
2427,KAYLIE,"here. So if you leave, you’re",3,female
2428,KAYLIE,leaving me alone with it.,3,female
2429,KAYLIE,Tim?,3,female
2430,KAYLIE,What do you mean? You walked over,3,female
2431,KAYLIE,here and sat down -,3,female
2432,KAYLIE,"No, you weren’t - did you think you",3,female
2433,KAYLIE,were? Would you mind saying it on,3,female
2434,KAYLIE,camera?,3,female
2435,KAYLIE,Is mommy -,3,female
2436,KAYLIE,We have to go eat. And I should,3,female

2441,KAYLIE,Maybe we should stay together.,3,female
2442,KAYLIE,"Oh, you bitch.",3,female
2443,KAYLIE,"And, we’ve lost electric. So",3,female
2444,KAYLIE,fucking predictable!,3,female
2445,KAYLIE,Tim?,3,female
2446,KAYLIE,It isn’t real.,3,female
2447,KAYLIE,Oww!,3,female
2448,KAYLIE,"No, no, no -",3,female
2449,KAYLIE,Say there’s nothing there! Say,3,female

2455,KAYLIE,You called for help.,3,female
2456,KAYLIE,"What if this is the trick, to keep",3,female
2457,KAYLIE,us standing there?,3,female
2458,KAYLIE,Call again.,3,female
2459,KAYLIE,What do we do?,3,female
2460,KAYLIE,And watch ourselves get ...,3,female
2461,KAYLIE,It’s not real.,3,female
2462,KAYLIE,Is he gone?,3,female
2463,KAYLIE,You have to make sure he’s gone,3,female
2464,KAYLIE,first.,3,female
2465,KAYLIE,Tim?,3,female
2466,KAYLIE,"Same old tricks, isn’t it?",3,female
2467,KAYLIE,I know it isn’t you. Because you’d,3,female

2472,KAYLIE,Tim?,3,female
2473,KAYLIE,All the studies say that you should,3,female
2474,KAYLIE,transition with a place that isn’t,3,female

2476,KAYLIE,some listings for studios and,3,female
2477,KAYLIE,efficiencies.,3,female
2478,KAYLIE,I found it.,3,female
2479,KAYLIE,It wasn’t easy. I tracked it down,3,female
2480,KAYLIE,"mostly through second-bidders,",3,female
2481,KAYLIE,"people who lost at the auctions,",3,female
2482,KAYLIE,"and anyway, it was in a chateau in",3,female
2483,KAYLIE,"Germany, one of those families with",3,female
2484,KAYLIE,an old name and no money who were,3,female
2485,KAYLIE,happy to find out what it would,3,female
2486,KAYLIE,bring in. It just sold so it’s,3,female
2487,KAYLIE,about to ship out to a new buyer.,3,female
2488,KAYLIE,"But we have a few days, which",3,female
2489,KAYLIE,should be enough.,3,female
2490,KAYLIE,I’ll never expect you to understand,3,female
2491,KAYLIE,that part of my life. Just bear me,3,female
2492,KAYLIE,"with me a day or two more, and then",3,female
2493,KAYLIE,it’s just going to be you and me.,3,female
2494,KAYLIE,From now on.,3,female
2495,KAYLIE,I promise.,3,female
2496,KAYLIE,Are you okay?,3,female
2497,KAYLIE,"Oh of course, you haven’t been here",3,female
2498,KAYLIE,"since ... I apologize, I didn’t",3,female
2499,KAYLIE,think about that.,3,female
2500,KAYLIE,Why don’t you look around?,3,female
2501,KAYLIE,Started working on the place after,3,female
2502,KAYLIE,graduation. I put in more,3,female
2503,KAYLIE,"thermostats, two more power boxes",3,female
2504,KAYLIE,"so we’re on three circuits now,",3,female
2505,KAYLIE,with a backup generator out back.,3,female
2506,KAYLIE,I’ve got to get started. Will you,3,female
2507,KAYLIE,help me move it before you leave?,3,female
2508,KAYLIE,Not yet. Over here for now.,3,female
2509,KAYLIE,I’ve got to get started. Are you,3,female
2510,KAYLIE,going or staying?,3,female
2511,KAYLIE,Hello. My name is Kaylie Ann,3,female
2512,KAYLIE,Russell. I’m 24 years old. I’m with,3,female
2513,KAYLIE,"my brother, Timothy Alan Russell -",3,female
2514,KAYLIE,"Alan, of course, after his father.",3,female
2515,KAYLIE,He is 21 years and four days old.,3,female
2516,KAYLIE,It is -,3,female
2517,KAYLIE,"4:15 PM, Pacific Standard Time, on",3,female
2518,KAYLIE,"October 13th, and we are at 2705",3,female
2519,KAYLIE,Hawthorne Way. I’ll begin by,3,female
2520,KAYLIE,detailing my precautions before I,3,female
2521,KAYLIE,place and uncover the glass.,3,female
2522,KAYLIE,"There are three cameras, each on",3,female
2523,KAYLIE,its own independent power circuit,3,female
2524,KAYLIE,"in case I have problems with them,",3,female
2525,KAYLIE,so if any anomalies occur there can,3,female
2526,KAYLIE,"be a lucent, objective record.",3,female
2527,KAYLIE,I have two land-lines with private,3,female
2528,KAYLIE,lines and numbers purely for,3,female
2529,KAYLIE,"today’s experiment, along with my",3,female
2530,KAYLIE,"cell phone, and I will now ask my",3,female
2531,KAYLIE,brother for his phone so that I may,3,female
2532,KAYLIE,control all electronic,3,female
2533,KAYLIE,communication devices.,3,female
2534,KAYLIE,This alarm is set to go off every,3,female
2535,KAYLIE,"45 minutes, to remind me to change",3,female
2536,KAYLIE,the tapes in the cameras.,3,female
2537,KAYLIE,"This alarm is set to go off hourly,",3,female
2538,KAYLIE,"to remind us to eat. So, no Robert",3,female
2539,KAYLIE,Clancy situations for us.,3,female
2540,KAYLIE,"As for the house itself, each room",3,female
2541,KAYLIE,"is fitted with its own thermostat,",3,female
2542,KAYLIE,from which data is collected by,3,female
2543,KAYLIE,custom software designed to track,3,female
2544,KAYLIE,and record temperature fluctuations,3,female
2545,KAYLIE,in hospitals. Any temperature,3,female
2546,KAYLIE,changes greater than five degrees,3,female
2547,KAYLIE,in either direction will set off an,3,female
2548,KAYLIE,alarm.,3,female
2549,KAYLIE,A third precaution is also in,3,female
2550,KAYLIE,"place, but I’ll get into that in a",3,female
2551,KAYLIE,"few more minutes, so ...",3,female
2552,KAYLIE,The purpose of today’s experiment,3,female
2553,KAYLIE,is to gather and document evidence,3,female
2554,KAYLIE,"that the object to my right, which",3,female
2555,KAYLIE,from this point I’ll refer to as,3,female
2556,KAYLIE,"the Lasser Glass, is an object of",3,female
2557,KAYLIE,innate supernatural characteristics,3,female
2558,KAYLIE,which manifest themselves in,3,female
2559,KAYLIE,predictable and quantifiable ways.,3,female
2560,KAYLIE,Because there’s no scientific term,3,female
2561,KAYLIE,"equivalent to the word “haunted,”",3,female
2562,KAYLIE,we’ll just say this object is,3,female
2563,KAYLIE,responsible for at least forty five,3,female
2564,KAYLIE,deaths in the four centuries of its,3,female
2565,KAYLIE,recorded existence -,3,female
2566,KAYLIE,"Philip Lasser, the 17th Earl of",3,female
2567,KAYLIE,"Leicester, acquired the mirror and",3,female
2568,KAYLIE,hung it over his grand fireplace -,3,female
2569,KAYLIE,"Ahh, okay. Another precaution ...",3,female
2570,KAYLIE,"Hi, whacha doing?",3,female
2571,KAYLIE,I’m expecting regular calls from my,3,female
2572,KAYLIE,"fiance, Eliot Dumont. I asked him",3,female
2573,KAYLIE,to check in on the excuse that I’m,3,female
2574,KAYLIE,nervous to be spending time with my,3,female
2575,KAYLIE,recently un-incarcerated brother -,3,female
2576,KAYLIE,"Lasser. So Philip Lasser’s wife,",3,female
2577,KAYLIE,"Virginia, was later found in their",3,female
2578,KAYLIE,"grand fireplace, burned beyond",3,female
2579,KAYLIE,recognition. Philip was never found,3,female
2580,KAYLIE,at all. While his estate was,3,female
2581,KAYLIE,dismantled and scattered throughout,3,female
2582,KAYLIE,"southern England, one of the",3,female
2583,KAYLIE,family’s stewards claimed to see,3,female
2584,KAYLIE,"Philip reflected in the mirror, or",3,female
2585,KAYLIE,wandering the castle at night -,3,female
2586,KAYLIE,- an allegation apparently taken,3,female
2587,KAYLIE,seriously enough to warrant a,3,female
2588,KAYLIE,church investigation into the,3,female
2589,KAYLIE,house. The glass - thereafter known,3,female
2590,KAYLIE,as the Lasser Glass - is sold in,3,female
2591,KAYLIE,public auction in 1758.,3,female
2592,KAYLIE,The next known owner is an American,3,female
2593,KAYLIE,railroad tycoon named Robert,3,female
2594,KAYLIE,"Clancy, 1864. Clancy apparently",3,female
2595,KAYLIE,weighed over 300 pounds; in fact he,3,female
2596,KAYLIE,was known to his friends as the,3,female
2597,KAYLIE,South Windham Whale.,3,female
2598,KAYLIE,He hung the mirror in his ballroom,3,female
2599,KAYLIE,"in Atlanta. Later that same year,",3,female
2600,KAYLIE,Robert Clancy is photographed by a,3,female
2601,KAYLIE,local newspaper -,3,female
2602,KAYLIE,- in which he appears to weigh no,3,female
2603,KAYLIE,more than one hundred pounds.,3,female
2604,KAYLIE,"Unfortunately he and his estate,",3,female
2605,KAYLIE,"and the glass, are presumably",3,female
2606,KAYLIE,destroyed in Sherman’s March to the,3,female
2607,KAYLIE,"ocean in 1865. After that, the",3,female
2608,KAYLIE,glass is lost until it resurfaces,3,female
2609,KAYLIE,in turn-of-the-century New England.,3,female
2610,KAYLIE,"The next owner of note, Mary",3,female
2611,KAYLIE,"O’Connor, lists the mirror in her",3,female
2612,KAYLIE,estate inventory. The mirror hangs,3,female
2613,KAYLIE,in her private bathroom for only,3,female
2614,KAYLIE,"two weeks, and the case probably",3,female
2615,KAYLIE,wouldn’t have been so well,3,female
2616,KAYLIE,documented if not for the strange,3,female
2617,KAYLIE,circumstances surrounding her,3,female
2618,KAYLIE,death.,3,female
2619,KAYLIE,Her niece Beatrice came to visit in,3,female
2620,KAYLIE,"March of 1904, and she found her",3,female

2623,KAYLIE,cause of death as - get this -,3,female

2625,KAYLIE,thirst while soaking in a full tub,3,female
2626,KAYLIE,for three days.,3,female
2627,KAYLIE,That’s just the beginning of that,3,female
2628,KAYLIE,family’s troubles with the glass.,3,female
2629,KAYLIE,Less than a month after moving into,3,female
2630,KAYLIE,"her late aunt’s home, Beatrice",3,female
2631,KAYLIE,suffers a complete and total mental,3,female
2632,KAYLIE,breakdown. Her sanity is just gone.,3,female
2633,KAYLIE,She kills two of her five children,3,female
2634,KAYLIE,"with her bare hands, and it takes",3,female
2635,KAYLIE,three officers to pull her from the,3,female
2636,KAYLIE,third. Her psychiatric admission,3,female
2637,KAYLIE,papers describe her behavior as,3,female
2638,KAYLIE,almost feral.,3,female

2643,KAYLIE,would have been in 1943.,3,female
2644,KAYLIE,Neighbors reported hearing screams,3,female
2645,KAYLIE,"and loud bangs from the house, and",3,female
2646,KAYLIE,local police were dispatched. The,3,female
2647,KAYLIE,children were found drowned in a,3,female
2648,KAYLIE,locked cistern. Alice herself is,3,female
2649,KAYLIE,found near death in the nursery.,3,female
2650,KAYLIE,Both of her legs are completely,3,female
2651,KAYLIE,shattered. Multiple fractures. Her,3,female
2652,KAYLIE,left arm is broken in four places,3,female
2653,KAYLIE,and six of her ribs are crushed. In,3,female
2654,KAYLIE,"her right hand is a large hammer,",3,female
2655,KAYLIE,presumably what she’s been using to,3,female
2656,KAYLIE,break her own bones. When the,3,female
2657,KAYLIE,"police find her, she’d been trying",3,female
2658,KAYLIE,to crack open her own skull. Her,3,female
2659,KAYLIE,"right arm, though, was completely",3,female
2660,KAYLIE,unharmed. Because she needed it to,3,female
2661,KAYLIE,wield the hammer.,3,female
2662,KAYLIE,Alice later says she believed she,3,female
2663,KAYLIE,was tucking the children into their,3,female
2664,KAYLIE,beds as she sealed them in the,3,female
2665,KAYLIE,cistern. She never recovers from,3,female
2666,KAYLIE,"her injuries. Oh, the family kept",3,female
2667,KAYLIE,"several dogs at the farm, including",3,female
