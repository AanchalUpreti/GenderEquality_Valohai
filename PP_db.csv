0,MRS BENNET," My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?",female
1,MRS BENNET, (cont'd) Do you not want to know who has taken it? ,female
2,MRS BENNET, What a fine thing for our girls!,female
3,MRS BENNET," My dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so tiresome! You know that he must marry one of them.",female
4,MRS BENNET, - So you must go and visit him at once.,female
5,MRS BENNET, At once!,female
6,MRS BENNET, You have?,female
7,MRS BENNET," How can you tease me, Mr Bennet? Have you no compassion for my poor nerves?",female
8,MRS BENNET, It is a pleasure. I have two others but they are already dancing.,female
9,MRS BENNET," Tell me quickly, my love",female
10,MRS BENNET, That dress becomes her does it not. Though of course my Jane needs little help from couturiers.,female
11,MRS BENNET, It is a pity she is not more handsome.,female
12,MRS BENNET, But Lizzie will never admit she is plain. (to Bingley) Of course it is my Jane Who is considered the beauty of the county.,female
13,MRS BENNET," When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman so much in love with her that I was sure he would make her an offer. However, he did write her some very pretty verses.",female
14,MRS BENNET," ...and then he danced the third with Miss Lucas. Poor thing, it is a shame she is not more handsome. There's a spinster in the making and no mistake. The fourth with a Miss King of little standing. And the fifth again with Jane.",female
15,MRS BENNET," Oh, Mr Bennet! The way you carry on, anybody would think the girls looked forward to a grand inheritance.",female
16,MRS BENNET," As you well know, Mr Bennet, when/ you die, which may in fact be very soon",female
17,MRS BENNET, - our girls will be left without a roof over their head nor a penny to their name. ,female
18,MRS BENNET, Praise the Lord! We are saved.,female
19,MRS BENNET, Out where? Let me see that.,female
20,MRS BENNET," Unaccountable of him. Dining out, indeed.",female
21,MRS BENNET, Excellent. Now she will have to stay the night. Exactly as I predicted.,female
22,MRS BENNET, People do not die of colds.,female
23,MRS BENNET," It's all going according to plan. He's head-over-heels already, now all he needs is a little encouragement.",female
24,MRS BENNET," Oh don't torment me, Mr Bennet. I mean Mr Bingley, as you well know, and he doesn't mind a bit that she hasn't a penny for he has enough for the two of them.",female
25,MRS BENNET," What an excellent room you have sir. Such expensive furnishings. I hope you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.",female
26,MRS BENNET, Less varied? Not at all! We dine with four and twenty families of all shapes and sizes. Sir William Lucas for instance is a very agreeable man. A good deal less self-important than some people of half his rank.,female
27,MRS BENNET," What a high and mighty man that Mr Darcy is, quite eaten up with pride.",female
28,MRS BENNET," Mr Collins, we are perfectly able to keep a cook.",female
29,MRS BENNET, Does she have any family?,female
30,MRS BENNET, I have become aware of the facto,female
31,MRS BENNET," Mr Collins, unfortunately it incumbent on me to hint that eldest Miss Bennet is - very soon to be engaged.",female
32,MRS BENNET," But Miss Lizzie next to her in both age and beauty would make anyone an excellent partner. Do not you agree, Mr Collins?",female
33,MRS BENNET," I dare say, I have never met a more pleasant gentleman in all my years. Did you see how he dotes on her! Dear, dear Jane. Always doing what is best for her family.",female
34,MRS BENNET, I have never had such a good time in my life. Mr Bingley you must have such a ball once a month at least.,female
35,MRS BENNET," Don't be impertinent. Our hosts are perfectly happy with our company, are you not, Mr Bingley? I hope I can entice you to Longbourn to sample our hospitality. We would make sure you had 3 or 4 courses at least.",female
36,MRS BENNET, (cont'd) So tell me Mr Bingley. Whom did you like least of all your guests this evening?,female
37,MRS BENNET," (V.O.) We will be having a wedding here at Netherfield in less than three months, if you ask me. Mr Bennet? Mr Bennet!",female
38,MRS BENNET, Oh! Yes. Certainly - Lizzie would be very happy indeed. Everyone. Out. Mr Collins would like a private audience with your sister.,female
39,MRS BENNET," No. Nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are. Everyone else, to the drawing room. Mr Bennet.",female
40,MRS BENNET, Now!,female
41,MRS BENNET, (V.O.) Sshhh.,female
42,MRS BENNET," Oh headstrong, foolish child",female
43,MRS BENNET," - don't worry Mr Collins, we shall have this little hiccup dealt with immediately.",female
44,MRS BENNET," Oh Mr Bennet. We are all in a uproar. You must come and make Lizzie marry Mr Collins, for she vows she will not have him.",female
45,MRS BENNET," (cont'd) Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie. But Lizzie declares she will not have him, and now the danger is Mr Collins may not have Lizzie.",female
46,MRS BENNET, Tell her that you insist upon them marrying.,female
47,MRS BENNET, You will have this house!,female
48,MRS BENNET, You'll save y6ur sisters from destitution!,female
49,MRS BENNET, Go back now and say you've changed your mind!,female
50,MRS BENNET," Mr Bennet, say something!",female
51,MRS BENNET," Yes, or I shall never see her again!",female
52,MRS BENNET, (to Lizzie) - who will maintain you when your father is dead?,female
53,MRS BENNET, Mr Bennet!,female
54,MRS BENNET," Oh, ungrateful child! I shall never speak to her again! Not that I have much pleasure in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer...",female
55,MRS BENNET, (distant) But it is always so. Those who complain are never pitied. . .,female
56,MRS BENNET," Give my love to my sister. And try not to be a burden, dear.",female
57,MRS BENNET," How fortunate you have arrived, your aunt and uncle are here to deliver Jane from London.",female
58,MRS BENNET, She's in the drawing room.,female
59,MRS BENNET," Oh, if I could but go to Brighton",female
60,MRS BENNET, A little sea-bathing would set me up very nicely.,female
61,MRS BENNET, I cried for two days when Colonel Miliar's regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.,female
62,MRS BENNET, Why did the Forsters let her out of their sight? I always said they were unfit to have charge of her.,female
63,MRS BENNET, You are all ruined. Who will take you now with a fallen sister? Poor Mr. Bennet will now have to fight the perfidious Wickham and then be killed,female
64,MRS BENNET, - and the Mr. Collins' will turn us out before he is cold in his grave,female
65,MRS BENNET," Lydia must know what this will do to my nerves, such flutterings and spasms all over me. . .",female
66,MRS BENNET, (O.S.) We are ruined. Ruined.,female
67,MRS BENNET," Lydia married! And at fifteen too! Ring the bell, Kitty! I must put on my things and tell Lady Lucas! Oh to see her face! And tell the servants they will have a bowl of punch!",female
68,MRS BENNET," And so he should help! He's much richer than us, and he hasn't got any children.",female
69,MRS BENNET," (cont'd) A daughter, married!",female
70,MRS BENNET," When you have five daughters, Lizzie, tell me what else will occupy your thoughts and then perhaps you will understand.",female
71,MRS BENNET," Now where will they live? Purvis Lodge might do. Ashworth is vacant of course, but it's too far off, I couldn't be as to have her ten miles from me",female
72,MRS BENNET," Write to me of ten, my dear!",female
73,MRS BENNET, Oh there is nothing so bad as parting with ones children! One seems so forlorn without them.,female
74,MRS BENNET, Mr. Bingley?,female
75,MRS BENNET," Tomorrow? (recovering) Not that I care about it. Mr. Bingley is nothing to us and I'm sure I never want to see him again. (moves away) No, we shall not mention a word about it. (comes back to Mrs. Hill) Is it quite certain he is coming?",female
76,MRS BENNET," Hm. Why he thinks we should be interested, I have no idea. Come along, girls.",female
77,MRS BENNET, Oh my goodness! Everybody behave naturally.,female
78,MRS BENNET," (cont'd) Whatever you do, do not appear -overbearing.",female
79,MRS BENNET, Mr. Darcy indeed! The very insolence of it. What does he think of coming here?,female
80,MRS BENNET," (to Mary - who is still playing) Stop that racket and sit down! Find yourself some work! Oh Lord. I shall have a seizure, I'm sure I shall.",female
81,MRS BENNET," (cont'd) How very glad we are to see you, Mr. Bingley! There are a great many changes since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters too, you will have seen it in the papers though it was not put in as it ought to have been. Very short, nothing about her family.",female
82,MRS BENNET," - but it's very hard to have my Lydia taken away from me. Mr. Wickham has been transferred to Newcastle, where ever that is. Thank heaven he has some friends.",female
83,MRS BENNET," When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley, I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please.",female
84,MRS BENNET," - Mr. Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you.",female
85,MRS BENNET, You must come again. For when you were in town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us. I have not forgot you see. At least three courses.,female
86,MRS BENNET," Everybody to the kitchen. Immediately. Except you, Jane, of course. Oh, Mr. Bingley. It is so good to see you again so soon.",female
87,MRS BENNET, Thank the Lord for that. I thought it would never happen.,female
88,MRS BENNET, Exceed their income? He has five thousand a year! I knew she could not be so beautiful for nothing.,female
89,MRS BENNET," All but one, the youngest has been lately married your ladyship. And my eldest was only proposed to yesterday afternoon.",female
90,MRS BENNET, Lizzie!,female
91,MRS BENNET," Lizzie, where have you been? We thought something had happened to you.",female
92,MRS BENNET, (cont'd) Mr. Darcy! What on earth are you doing here?,female
93,MR BENNET," As you wish to tell me, I doubt I have any choice in the matter.",male
94,MR BENNET, How can it affect them?,male
95,MR BENNET," Oh, so that is his design in settling here?",male
96,MR BENNET," There is no need, for I already have.",male
97,MR BENNET," You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for them; they have been my constant companions these twenty years.",male
98,MR BENNET, I will give my hearty consent to his marrying whichever of the girls he chooses. Warts and all.,male
99,MR BENNET, I believe so.,male
100,MR BENNET, You've decided to take the veil?,male
101,MR BENNET, If he'd had any compassion for me he would have sprained his ankle in the first set.,male
102,MR BENNET," Kitty, be so kind as to pass the butter.",male
103,MR BENNET, As soon as I can manage it.,male
104,MR BENNET," Good grief, woman. Your matchmaking skills are becoming positively occult.",male
105,MR BENNET," Well, my dear, if your daughter does die it will be a comfort to know it was all in pursuit of Mr Bingley.",male
106,MR BENNET," Who's that, my blossom?",male
107,MR BENNET," I hope, my dear, that you have ordered a good dinner today, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.",male
108,MR BENNET," (gravely) How happy for you, Mr Collins, to possess the talent for flattering with such delicacy.",male
109,MR BENNET, But...,male
110,MR BENNET, And what am I to do?,male
111,MR BENNET," (to Lizzie) SO, your mother insists on you marrying Mr Collins.",male
112,MR BENNET, Well Lizzie. From this day on 'you must be a stranger to one of your parents.,male
113,MR BENNET," Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.",male
114,MR BENNET," Poor Jane. However, a girl likes to be crossed in love now and then. It gives her something to think of, and a sort of distinction among her companions.",male
115,MR BENNET," Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little inconvenience as under the present circumstances.",male
116,MR BENNET, We shall have no peace until she goes.,male
117,MR BENNET," Colonel Forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief, and she is far too poor to be an object of prey to anyone.",male
118,MR BENNET," I'm sure the officers will find women better worth their while. Let us hope, in fact, that her stay in Brighton will teach her her own insignificance. At any rate she can hardly grow any worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life.",male
119,MR BENNET, Excuse me.,male
120,MR BENNET, I am. . . (his voice breaks up - he clears his throat) I am looking for a Mr. Wickham.,male
121,MR BENNET," For God's sake let me be! (to Lizzie) Lizzie, help me with my boots.",male
122,MR BENNET, (nods ) Where else could they be so well concealed?,male
123,MR BENNET, It's been my own doing.,male
124,MR BENNET, No Lizzie. Let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. (wan smile) I am not afraid of being overpowered by the experience. It will pass away soon enough.,male
125,MR BENNET, As it is addressed to me...,male
126,MR BENNET, (cont'd) He's found them.,male
127,MR BENNET, (squinting at the letter) Just wait. I can't make out his script.,male
128,MR BENNET, Of course I will agree. But how much your uncle has laid on this wretched man already is anybody's guess.,male
129,MR BENNET, No man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as a hundred a year.,male
130,MR BENNET, Your uncle is very generous.,male
131,MR BENNET, Wickham's a fool if he takes her for less than ten thousand pounds.,male
132,MR BENNET," Before you take any of these houses, Mrs. Bennet, let us be clear. Into one house she will never be welcome.",male
133,MR BENNET, (nods coldly) I'm glad to hear of it.,male
134,MR BENNET, That is out of the question.,male
135,MR BENNET," I am sure they will do well together, their tempers are much alike. They will be cheated assiduously by their servants, and be so generous with the rest, they will always exceed their income.",male
136,MR BENNET," (tentatively) Could I offer you a cup of tea perhaps, your Ladyship?",male
137,MR BENNET," Lizzie, what on earth is going on?",male
138,MR BENNET," Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I thought you hated the man.",male
139,MR BENNET," He is rich, to be sure, and you will have more fine carriages than Jane. But will that make you happy?",male
140,MR BENNET," None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow, but this would be nothing if you really liked him.",male
141,MR BENNET, Good Lord. I must pay him back.,male
142,MR BENNET," You do love him, don't you?",male
143,MR BENNET," I cannot believe that anyone can deserve you, but it seems I am over-ruled. So I heartily give my consent.",male
144,MR BENNET," (cont'd) I could not have parted with you, my Lizzie, to any one less worthy.",male
145,MR BENNET," (calls out after her) And if any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.",male
146,LIZZIE, Liddy! Kitty - what have I told you about listening at - ,female
147,LIZZIE, Really?,female
148,LIZZIE," A Mr Bingley, apparently.",female
149,LIZZIE," Oh, really Kitty.",female
150,LIZZIE," ( ironically) With five thousand a year, would not matter if he had warts and a leer.",female
151,LIZZIE," Well, if every man in this room does not end the evening in love with you then I am no judge of beauty.",female
152,LIZZIE," Oh, they are far too easy to judge.",female
153,LIZZIE," Humourless poppycocks, in my limited experience.",female
154,LIZZIE, So which of the painted peacocks is our Mr Bingley?,female
155,LIZZIE, And the person with the quizzical brow?,female
156,LIZZIE," He looks miserabIe, poor soul.",female
157,LIZZIE, TeIl me.,female
158,LIZZIE," The library at Netherfield, I've heard, is one of the finest in the country.",female
159,LIZZIE, Do you dance Mr Darcy?,female
160,LIZZIE," Precisely. As it is, I would not dance with him for all of Derbyshire, let alone the miserable half.",female
161,LIZZIE, Yes! I adore her.,female
162,LIZZIE, Mama!,female
163,LIZZIE, (impatiently) And that put paid to it. I wonder who first discovered the power of poetry in driving away love?,female
164,LIZZIE," Of a fine, stout love it may. But if it is only a vague inclination, I am convinced that one poor sonnet will kill it stone dead.",female
165,LIZZIE, Dancing. Even if ones partner is barely tolerable.,female
166,LIZZIE," (completing the list) Handsome, conveniently rich",female
167,LIZZIE," I agree entirely, only the deepest love will persuade me into matrimony, which is why I will end up an old maid.",female
168,LIZZIE," Jane, he danced with you most of the night and stared at you for the rest of it. But I give you leave to like him. You've liked many a stupider person.",female
169,LIZZIE," You're a great deal too apt to like people in general, you know. All the world is good and agreeable in your eyes.",female
170,LIZZIE, Mr Darcy? I could more easily forgive his vanity had he not wounded mine. But no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak again.,female
171,LIZZIE," Oh Mother, please! It's ten in the morning.",female
172,LIZZIE, Mama! The carriage? For Jane? MRS BENNET Certainly not. She'll go on horseback.,female
173,LIZZIE," Though I don't think, Mama, you can reasonably take credit for making it rain. Let's hope she doesn't catch her death.",female
174,LIZZIE," ""And my kind friends will not hear of me returning home until I am better - but do not be alarmed excepting a sore throat, a fever, and a headache there is nothing wrong with me."" I hope you're satisfied, Mother.",female
175,LIZZIE, Though she might well perish with the shame of having such a mother.,female
176,LIZZIE, (cont'd) I am going to Netherfield at once.,female
177,LIZZIE, I have. I'm so sorry. How is my sister?,female
178,LIZZIE, How is she?,female
179,LIZZIE, Jane!,female
180,LIZZIE," Don't worry. I don't know who is more pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley.",female
181,LIZZIE, Goodness! You must comprehend a great deal in the idea.,female
182,LIZZIE, I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished w6men. I rather wonder now at your knowing any.,female
183,LIZZIE, I never saw such a woman. She would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.,female
184,LIZZIE," And it's a small kind of accomplishment, I suppose.",female
185,LIZZIE, Our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it. ,female
186,LIZZIE, We could always laugh at him.,female
187,LIZZIE," Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would you consider pride a fault or a virtue?",female
188,LIZZIE, Because we're doing our best to find a fault in you.,female
189,LIZZIE," Oh dear, I cannot tease you about that. What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh. ",female
190,LIZZIE," Jane, do you think you might feel weIl enough to leave today?",female
191,LIZZIE, (trying to stop Bingley being bamboozled) Kitty�,female
192,LIZZIE," Thank you, Mary.",female
193,LIZZIE," (to Caroline) Thank you, for such stimulating company. It has been most instructive.",female
194,LIZZIE, Mr Darcy.,female
195,LIZZIE," (to the coachman) Thomas, can't you drive around them?",female
196,LIZZIE, His name is Mr Collins. He's the dreaded cousin.,female
197,LIZZIE," Indeed. Everything, apparently. He may leave us our stays, but even my piano stool belongs to Mr Collins.",female
198,LIZZIE, He can turn us out of the house as soon as he pleases.,female
199,LIZZIE, Because the estate is entailed to him and not to us poor females.,female
200,LIZZIE, Do these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are they the result of previous study?,female
201,LIZZIE," Believe me, no one would suspect your manners to be rehearsed.",female
202,LIZZIE, (gravely) Only a man truly confident of himself would admit that.,female
203,LIZZIE, Dear oh dear. You must be the shame of the regiment.,female
204,LIZZIE, What do your superiors do with you?,female
205,LIZZIE," You already owe me a fortune, Liddy.",female
206,LIZZIE, No! Please - Mr Wickham,female
207,LIZZIE, I pity the French.,female
208,LIZZIE," Will you come to the Netherfield ball then, Mr Wickham?",female
209,LIZZIE, About a month. Forgive me but are you acquainted with him? With Mr Darcy?,female
210,LIZZIE, I hope your plans in favour of Meryton will not be affected by your difficult relations with the gentleman.,female
211,LIZZIE," I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?",female
212,LIZZIE, How so?,female
213,LIZZIE, Why did he do that?,female
214,LIZZIE, Cruel! Cruel! Are you sure?,female
215,LIZZIE," (exasperated laugh) Oh Jane, do you never think ill of anybody?",female
216,LIZZIE," If it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict it himself. But until he does, I hope never to encounter him.",female
217,LIZZIE," On the contrary, he is twice the man Darcy is.",female
218,LIZZIE," No, no not at all, admiring the general splendour.",female
219,LIZZIE, Have you seen Mr Wickham?,female
220,LIZZIE, Detained?,female
221,LIZZIE, Mr Collins. What a pleasant surprise.,female
222,LIZZIE," Oh. I didn't think you danced, Mr Collins.",female
223,LIZZIE, That gentleman barely warrants the name.,female
224,LIZZIE, You may.,female
225,LIZZIE, (cont'd) Did I just agree to dance with Mr Darcy?,female
226,LIZZIE, Which would be most inconvenient since I have sworn to loathe him for all eternity.,female
227,LIZZIE, I love a Sarabande.,female
228,LIZZIE, That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But for now we may be silent.,female
229,LIZZIE," (slightly irritable) No, no - I prefer to be unsociable and taciturn. That makes it all so much more enjoyable, don't you think?",female
230,LIZZIE, Very mild weather we've been having.,female
231,LIZZIE," Yes, we of ten walk to Meryton it is a great opportunity to meet new people. In fact when you met us we had just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.",female
232,LIZZIE, He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship. And I dare say that is an irreversible event?,female
233,LIZZIE," To make out your character, Mr Darcy.",female
234,LIZZIE, Very little.,female
235,LIZZIE, (cont'd) I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.,female
236,LIZZIE, But sir,female
237,LIZZIE, (surprised) He is?,female
238,LIZZIE," (cont'd) Please, Mr Collins! He'll consider it an impertinence",female
239,LIZZIE, Mother. I really think it is time to go.,female
240,LIZZIE, Wait. I beg you. Mr Collins can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.,female
241,LIZZIE, Mr Collins,female
242,LIZZIE," You are too hasty, sir! You forget that I have made no answer.",female
243,LIZZIE," Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but regret I must decline it.",female
244,LIZZIE," (in some desperation) Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You could not make happy and I'm convinced I'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy.",female
245,LIZZIE," (rising, deeply affronted) Mr Collins -",female
246,LIZZIE, Sir! I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man. Please understand me - I cannot accept you!,female
247,LIZZIE," Papa, please - !",female
248,LIZZIE, I can't marry him!,female
249,LIZZIE, I can't!,female
250,LIZZIE, No!,female
251,LIZZIE, You can/t make me!,female
252,LIZZIE," Thank you, papa.",female
253,LIZZIE," What's wrong, Jane?",female
254,LIZZIE, I don't understand. What would take him from Netherfield? Why would he not know when he was to return?,female
255,LIZZIE," ""Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister and we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance and accomplishments, so much so I must hope to hereafter call her my sister.""",female
256,LIZZIE, Caroline sees that her brother is in love with you and has taken him off to persuade him otherwise.,female
257,LIZZIE," He loves you, Jane. Do not give up. Go to our aunt and uncle's in London. Let it be known you are there and I am sure he will come to you.",female
258,LIZZIE," (dryly) I'm sure that will cheer her up, Papa.",female
259,LIZZIE, Engaged?,female
260,LIZZIE, To be married?,female
261,LIZZIE, But he's ridiculous.,female
262,LIZZIE, Charlotte,female
263,LIZZIE, All of them?,female
264,LIZZIE," (V.O.) Dear Charlotte, I am so glad the house, furniture,neighbourhood and roads are all to your taste",female
265,LIZZIE," (V.O.)- and that Lady Catherine's behaviour is friendly and obliging. As for the favour you ask, it is no favour at all, I would be glad to visit you at your earliest convenience.",female
266,LIZZIE, ( alarmed) What's happened?,female
267,LIZZIE, Mr Darcy! What are you doing here?,female
268,LIZZIE," Yes, madam, I had the pleasure of meeting your nephew in Hertfordshire.",female
269,LIZZIE," Really? Caroline will be disappointed to hear that. (looks at the girl, and whispers to Charlotte) What a miserabIe little thing! They should suit each other perfectly.",female
270,LIZZIE," A little, ma'am, and very poorly.",female
271,LIZZIE," No, not at all.",female
272,LIZZIE, Not one.,female
273,LIZZIE, We never had a governess.,female
274,LIZZIE," (can't help smiling at this) Not at all, Lady Catherine.",female
275,LIZZIE," Yes, ma'am. All.",female
276,LIZZIE," Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I think it would be very hard on younger sisters, not to have their share of amusement because the elder is still unmarried. And to be kept back on such a motive! It would hardly encourage sisterly affection.",female
277,LIZZIE," (smiles) With three younger sisters grown up, your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own to it.",female
278,LIZZIE," No, I beg you",female
279,LIZZIE," Lady Catherine, I am not afflicted with false modesty and when I say I play poorly ...",female
280,LIZZIE," You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy, by coming in all your state to hear me, but I won't be alarmed even though your sister does play so well.",female
281,LIZZIE, You really care to know?,female
282,LIZZIE," (cont'd) Prepare yourself for something very dreadful. (stops playing) The first time I saw him, at the Assembly, he danced with nobody at all - even though gentlemen were scarce and there was more than one young lady who was sitting down without a partner.",female
283,LIZZIE," (smiles sweetly) True, aMRS.nd nobody can be introduced in a ballroom.",female
284,LIZZIE, Perhaps you should take your aunt's advice and practice.,female
285,LIZZIE, (astonished) Mr Darcy!,female
286,LIZZIE," (cont'd) Please, do be seated. (pause) I'm afraid Mr and Mrs Collins are gone on business to the village.",female
287,LIZZIE, I believe so - and she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful subject.,female
288,LIZZIE, He is indeed lucky to have found one of the few sensible women who would have accepted him.,female
289,LIZZIE, I have no idea.,female
290,LIZZIE," How long do you plan to stay in Kent, Colonel?",female
291,LIZZIE, Everyone appears to be at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry and secure a lasting convenience of that kind.,female
292,LIZZIE, Really?,female
293,LIZZIE, (faltering slightly) Who was the man?,female
294,LIZZIE, Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?,female
295,LIZZIE, I don't understand...,female
296,LIZZIE," (voice shaking) Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have been through, and I am very sorry to have caused you pain. Believe me, it was unconsciously done.",female
297,LIZZIE," Yes, sir.",female
298,LIZZIE, No!,female
299,LIZZIE," (pause) I'm sure that the feelings which, as you've told me, have hindered your regard, will help you in overcoming it.",female
300,LIZZIE," (trembling with emotion) I might as well enquire why, with so evident a design of insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your better judgement. If I was uncivil, that was some excuse -",female
301,LIZZIE," But I have other reasons, you know I have!",female
302,LIZZIE," Do you think that anything might tempt me to accept the man who has ruined, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?",female
303,LIZZIE," (cont'd) Do you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you've separated a young couple who loved each other, exposing your friend to the censure of the world for caprice, and my sister to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind?",female
304,LIZZIE, (blurts out) How could you do it?,female
305,LIZZIE, That's because she's shy!,female
306,LIZZIE, Because you suggested it!,female
307,LIZZIE," My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me! (pause, takes a breath) I suppose you suspect that his fortune had same bearing on the matter?",female
308,LIZZIE, What was?,female
309,LIZZIE, Did my sister give that impression?,female
310,LIZZIE, Our want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't vex himself about that!,female
311,LIZZIE," How, sir?",female
312,LIZZIE, (icy) And what about Mr Wickham?,female
313,LIZZIE, What excuse can you give for your behaviour to him?,female
314,LIZZIE, He told me of his misfortunes.,female
315,LIZZIE," You have ruined his chances, and yet treat him with sarcasm?",female
316,LIZZIE, My pride?,female
317,LIZZIE," And those are the words of a gentleman? From the first moment I met you, your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, made me realize that you were the last man in the world I could ever be prevailed upon to marry.",female
318,LIZZIE, I was caught off-guard.,female
319,LIZZIE," No! Charlotte, I shall be quite all right. Please, give Lady de Bourgh my apologies. You must not keep her waiting.",female
320,LIZZIE, I hardly know.,female
321,LIZZIE, How is Jane?,female
322,LIZZIE, Oh Jane?,female
323,LIZZIE," Kitty, what's happened?",female
324,LIZZIE, Mother! Are you all mad?,female
325,LIZZIE," Please Papa, don't let her go!",female
326,LIZZIE," (with great emotion) If you, dear father, will not take the trouble to check her, she will be fixed forever as the silliest and most determined flirt who ever made her family ridiculous. And Kitty will follow, as she always does.",female
327,LIZZIE, (really angry now) Peace! Is that all you care about?,female
328,LIZZIE," Father, it's dangerous!",female
329,LIZZIE, No wonder our family is treated with contempt.,female
330,LIZZIE," Believe me, men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity. And if they are amiable they're so easily led that they have no minds of their own whatsoever.",female
331,LIZZIE, I saw Mr. Darcy when I was in Rosings.,female
332,LIZZIE, I would rather stay here.,female
333,LIZZIE, (very uncomfortable) I must own that I'm tired of great houses. All those carpets and curtains...,female
334,LIZZIE," - if Pemberley is anything like Mr. Darcy, I am sure I will not be able to bear it.",female
335,LIZZIE, I hear that Pemberley is not far from here.,female
336,LIZZIE," You see something of the owner, do you, in town?",female
337,LIZZIE, Only a little.,female
338,LIZZIE," Yes, yes I daresay he is.",female
339,LIZZIE, Are they at home?,female
340,LIZZIE, I thought you were in London.,female
341,LIZZIE, (cont'd) I'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and aunt.,female
342,LIZZIE, Very pleasant. Tomorrow we go to Matlock.,female
343,LIZZIE, Yes. At the Rose and Crown.,female
344,LIZZIE, (cont'd) I'm so sorry to intrude. They said the house was open for visitors. I had no idea...,female
345,LIZZIE, Oh no! I'm very fond of walking.,female
346,LIZZIE, (stares) To dine with him?,female
347,LIZZIE, His sister?,female
348,LIZZIE," Oh, thank you.",female
349,LIZZIE, (cont'd) What a beautiful pianoforte.,female
350,LIZZIE, Your unfortunate brother once had to put up with my playing for a whole evening.,female
351,LIZZIE, Then he has perjured himself most profoundly.,female
352,LIZZIE, Quite well is not verywell. I am satisfied.,female
353,LIZZIE," Yes, very.",female
354,LIZZIE," That is a kindness he will never forget, Sir.",female
355,LIZZIE, Only when forced.,female
356,LIZZIE, It is so beautiful up here. I will be sorry to leave.,female
357,LIZZIE, (cont'd) You have been a most gracious host. I'm sure my aunt and uncle will talk of nothing else for days.,female
358,LIZZIE," It does you credit, sir.",female
359,LIZZIE, (delighted) It's from Jane.,female
360,LIZZIE," No, I'm perfectly well. Truly.",female
361,LIZZIE," (cont'd) It is the most dreadful news. Lydia has run away - with Mr. Wickham. They are gone together from Brighton to Lord knows where. She has no money, no connections, I fear she is lost forever.",female
362,LIZZIE," No, it is my fault. I might have prevented all of it merely by being open with my sisters.",female
363,LIZZIE, Father has gone to London. But I know very well that nothing can be done. We have not the smallest hope.,female
364,LIZZIE," Sir, I think it is too late.",female
365,LIZZIE," He hasn't found him yet, Mama.",female
366,LIZZIE," Don't judge her, Kitty. It is, after all, hardest on her.",female
367,LIZZIE, The difficulty is not knowing anything.,female
368,LIZZIE," Oh father, I'm so sorry.",female
369,LIZZIE, You mustn't be too severe on yourself.,female
370,LIZZIE, Give it to me. (she reads),female
371,LIZZIE," They will be, if father will settle a hundred pounds a year on her. That is Wickham's condition.",female
372,LIZZIE," You will agree to this, father?",female
373,LIZZIE," Ah, I see.",female
374,LIZZIE, Do you think it a large sum?,female
375,LIZZIE," We should thank our uncle, Mama.",female
376,LIZZIE, Is that all you think about?,female
377,LIZZIE, (in desperation) You don't know what he's like.,female
378,LIZZIE, (furious) Lydia!,female
379,LIZZIE, I don't want to hear,female
380,LIZZIE, Can't you understand why?,female
381,LIZZIE, (stares) Mr. Darcy?,female
382,LIZZIE, Mr. Darcy was at your wedding?,female
383,LIZZIE, Mr. Darcy?,female
384,LIZZIE, (nods ) I met Mr. Darcy's sister.,female
385,LIZZIE, Very much. (looks at him) We found a great deal to talk about.,female
386,LIZZIE, (cont'd) (low voice) Why was Mr. Darcy there?,female
387,LIZZIE," Please, Lydia! Please, please tell me.",female
388,LIZZIE, (stares) For what?,female
389,LIZZIE, Everything?,female
390,LIZZIE, Why? Why did he do it?,female
391,LIZZIE," Do you hope to stay long in the country, Mr. Bingley?",female
392,LIZZIE," Are you well, Mr. Darcy?",female
393,LIZZIE," Well, I hope the weather stays fine, for your sport.",female
394,LIZZIE, (a pause) So soon? ,female
395,LIZZIE, (laughing) Oh yes?,female
396,LIZZIE, I think you are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.,female
397,LIZZIE, Don't say that.,female
398,LIZZIE," Oh Jane, I have been so blind.",female
399,LIZZIE, How did he account for it?,female
400,LIZZIE, Unfathomable.,female
401,LIZZIE, Bravo! That is the most unforgiving speech you've ever made.,female
402,LIZZIE, Perhaps Mr. Collins has a cousin.It's no less than I deserve.,female
403,LIZZIE, Lady Catherine!,female
404,LIZZIE, Indeed you are mistaken. I cannot account for this honour at all.,female
405,LIZZIE," If you believed it impossible, I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.",female
406,LIZZIE," (coolly) Your coming here will be rather a confirmation, surely, if indeed such a report exists. ",female
407,LIZZIE, I have never heard of it.,female
408,LIZZIE," I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask the questions, which I may not choose to answer.",female
409,LIZZIE, Your Ladyship declared it to be impossible.,female
410,LIZZIE, Only this - if that is the case you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.,female
411,LIZZIE, I am not.,female
412,LIZZIE, I will not. And I certainly never shall. You have insulted me in every possible way and can now have nothing further to say. I must ask you to leave immediately. Good night.,female
413,LIZZIE, Just a small misunderstanding.,female
414,LIZZIE, For once in your life. Just leave me alone.,female
415,LIZZIE, I couldn't sleep,female
416,LIZZIE," After what you have done for Lydia and for all I know, for Jane also, it is I who should be making amends.",female
417,LIZZIE," Well, then.",female
418,LIZZIE, (cont'd) You're cold.,female
419,LIZZIE, Mr. Darcy has come to speak with Papa.,female
420,LIZZIE," No, Papa.",female
421,LIZZIE, (uncomfortable) Have you no other objection than your belief in my indifference?,female
422,LIZZIE," (tears in her eyes) I do like him! (with passion) I love him! He's not proud. I was wrong, entirely wrong about him. You don't know him, Papa.. if I told you what he's really like. What he's done.",female
423,LIZZIE," (shakes her head) No, you mustn't tell anyone! He wouldn't want it. (pause) We misjudged him, me more than anyone. In every way, not just in this matter. I've been nonsensical. He's been a fool! About Jane, about so many things. Then so have I... (breathless pause) You see, he and I are so similar.. .we're both so stubborn. . . (shaky laugh) Oh Papa. . .",female
424,LIZZIE, (nods) Very much.,female
425,LIZZIE, Oh thank you!,female
426,LIZZIE," Very well, only I wish you would not call me ""my dear"".",female
427,LIZZIE, It's what my father always calls my mother when he's cross about something.,female
428,LIZZIE, Let me think. Lizzie for everyday. My Pearl for Sundays and Goddess Divine - but only on special occasions.,female
429,LIZZIE, (suddenly serious) Oh no. You can only call me Mrs. Darcy when you are entirely and perfectly and incandescently happy.,female
430,LYDIA," Never mind that, there's a Mr Bingley arrived from the North",female
431,LYDIA, - and five thousand a year!,female
432,LYDIA, And he's single!,female
433,LYDIA, Are you listening? You never listen.,female
434,LYDIA, He's sure to be handsome.,female
435,LYDIA, So will he come to the ball tomorrow?,female
436,LYDIA," No, I need it! It makes Kitty look like a pudding.",female
437,LYDIA, I can't breathe. How am I going to dance all night if I can't breathe?,female
438,LYDIA, Mama! You will never ever ever ever believe what I'm about to tell you! ,female
439,LYDIA, ( shrieking) The regiment are coming!,female
440,LYDIA, Officers! Officers as far as the eye can see!,female
441,LYDIA, It's easy. You just walk up and down in front of them and drop something.,female
442,LYDIA," Mr Bingley, is it true that you have promised to hold a ball here at Netherfield?",female
443,LYDIA, It would be an excellent way to meet new friends. You could invite the militia. They are excellent company.,female
444,LYDIA, I can't believe it! They're close enough to touch! ,female
445,LYDIA," Oh! See! The blonde! Oh, be still my beating heart!",female
446,LYDIA," There was one with great long lashes, like a cow, did you see him? He looked right at me.",female
447,LYDIA," Oh how perfect you are, Mr Wickham!",female
448,LYDIA, Mr Wickham's a lieutenant.,female
449,LYDIA, We just happened to be looking for some ribbon,female
450,LYDIA," Lizzie, lend me some money!",female
451,LYDIA," Mr Bingley, how do you like my ribbons for your ball?",female
452,LYDIA, She is! Look at her! She's blooming,female
453,LYDIA," Be sure to invite Mr Wickham, he's a credit to his profession.",female
454,LYDIA, I hate this walk. It's always too far.,female
455,LYDIA, Aggghh!,female
456,LYDIA, They're leaving for Brighton. I want to die.,female
457,LYDIA, Not a word of warning!,female
458,LYDIA, (smugly) Mrs. Forster has invited me.,female
459,LYDIA, - because I'm better company.,female
460,LYDIA, I shall dine with the officers every night!,female
461,LYDIA," - and then we passed Sarah Sims in her carriage so I took off my glove and let my hand just rest on the window frame, so she might see the ring, and then bowed and smiled like anything!",female
462,LYDIA," You must all go to Brighton, for that is the place to get husbands! I hope you have half my good luck.",female
463,LYDIA," Well, Monday morning came and I was in such a fuss",female
464,LYDIA," - there was my aunt, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon, she was horrid unpleasant",female
465,LYDIA, - but I didn't hear a word because I was thinking of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.,female
466,LYDIA, - and then my uncle was called away from the church on business and I thought - who is to be our best man if he doesn't come back? Lucky he did come back or I would have had to ask Mr. Darcy,female
467,LYDIA, (claps her hand to her mouth) I forgot! I shouldn't have said a word!,female
468,LYDIA," (whispers) He was the one that discovered us! He knew where to find Wickham, you see. (hisses) But don't tell anyone! He told me not to tell!",female
469,LYDIA," Oh stop it, Lizzie. Mr. Darcy's not half as high and mighty as you, sometimes.",female
470,LYDIA," Come on, Wickham! You've got to play.",female
471,LYDIA, I'm not supposed to tell.,female
472,LYDIA, Because he paid for it.,female
473,LYDIA," (carelessly) The wedding, Wickham's commission. Everything.",female
474,LYDIA," People kept saying Wickham owed them money, it was so tedious. So Darcy settled his debts but I don't really like him, do you?",female
475,LYDIA," (shrugs) I don't know, do I? Anyway you're not to tell because it's supposed to be our uncle who paid, and he wouldn't have minded paying, either,_because I'm his favorite.",female
476,LYDIA, Married women never have much time for writing. My sisters may write to me! They'll have nothing else to do.,female
477,KITTY, - with more than one chaise,female
478,KITTY, Shhhh!,female
479,KITTY," You must, Papa!",female
480,KITTY," (to Jane) I have to have your spotted muslin, Jane!",female
481,KITTY," - Oh please Jane, I'll lend you my green slippers.",female
482,KITTY, My toes hurt already.,female
483,KITTY," They're to be stationed the whole winter! Stationed in the village, just right there!",female
484,KITTY, How will we meet them?,female
485,KITTY, Oh do hold a ball.,female
486,KITTY, I think one of them just winked at me_ ,female
487,KITTY," He picked up my glove, too. Did you drop yours on purpose, Lizzie? ",female
488,KITTY," White, for the ball!",female
489,KITTY, My feet hurt.,female
490,KITTY, They got the call this morning.,female
491,KITTY," Lizzie, tell mama, tell her!",female
492,KITTY, (wails) Why didn't she ask me as well?,female
493,KITTY, I've just as much right as Lydia,female
494,KITTY," - and more so, because I'm two years older!",female
495,KITTY, How long is this going to go on for?,female
496,KITTY," - who is to fight Wickham and make him marry Lydia, now you've come home?",female
497,KITTY, Are they married?,female
498,KITTY, Are they married?,female
499,KITTY, A hundred pounds!,female
500,KITTY," What do you mean, Father?",female
501,KITTY, Can I come and stay with you?,female
502,KITTY," Yes, come on!",female
503,KITTY, (calls) Lydia! It's your turn!,female
504,KITTY," He is here! He is here, he's at the door! Mr. Bingley!",female
505,KITTY, Look. There's someone with him. Mr. what's-his-name. The pompous one from before.,female
506,KITTY, (at the window) It is him. He's back. He's come again.,female
507,JANE, Who's single?,female
508,JANE, When?,female
509,JANE, Or men.,female
510,JANE, They are not all bad.,female
511,JANE," One of these days, Lizzie, someone will catch your eye and then you'll have to watch your tongue.",female
512,JANE," How do you like it here in Hertfordshire, Mr Bingley?",female
513,JANE," I wish I read more, but there always seems so many other things to do.",female
514,JANE," Oh! Mama, please!",female
515,JANE, You know perfectly weIl I do not believe marriage should be driven by thoughts of money.,female
516,JANE," Do you really believe he liked me, Lizzie?",female
517,JANE, Lizzie!,female
518,JANE, Not his friend. I still cannot believe what he said about you.,female
519,JANE, It is from Caroline.,female
520,JANE, (cont'd) She has invited me to dine with her. (pause) Her brother will be dining out.,female
521,JANE, Can I take the carriage?,female
522,JANE, It is too far too walk.,female
523,JANE," Lizzie! Oh, your face is so cold. They're being so kind to me, I feel such a terrible imposition.",female
524,JANE, (to the Bingleys) I don't know how to thank you.,female
525,JANE," Oh do stop, Lizzie, l've got no more breath!",female
526,JANE," What are you up to, Liddy?",female
527,JANE, Lydia!,female
528,JANE, Lydia you can't invite people to other people's ball.,female
529,JANE, Nearly there.,female
530,JANE, - I still think there must have been a misunderstanding.,female
531,JANE, How could Mr Darcy do such a thing? I will discover the truth from Mr Bingley at the balI this evening.,female
532,JANE," Poor, unfortunate Mr Wickham.",female
533,JANE," And let us hope, a rather more willing dancer.",female
534,JANE, And so am I.,female
535,JANE," It is breath-taking, Mr Bingley.",female
536,JANE, He's not here. Apparently otherwise detained.,female
537,JANE," Apparently your Mr Wickham has been called on some business to town, though my informer told me he would have been less inclined to be engaged had it not been for the presence at Netherfield of a certain gentleman.",female
538,JANE, Read it. I don't mind.,female
539,JANE, Is that not clear enough?,female
540,JANE, But I know her to be incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone. It is far more likely that he does not love me and never has.,female
541,JANE," I am quite over him, Lizzie. If he passed in the street I would hardly notice. London is so diverting.",female
542,JANE, It's true. So much to entertain. What news from Kent?,female
543,JANE, Lydia has been invited to Brighton with the Foresters.,female
544,JANE, Why did you not tell me? Did he mention Mr. Bingley?,female
545,JANE," Do not be alarmed, mama. Our uncle is helping in the search.",female
546,JANE, Look. It's Papa!,female
547,JANE, You suppose them to be still in London?,female
548,JANE, It's to Papa. It's in Uncle's writing.,female
549,JANE, See what?,female
550,JANE, Ten thousand! Heaven forbid!,female
551,JANE," It's all right, Lizzie. I'm just glad that he comes alone, because then we shall see less of him. Not that I'm afraid of myself, but I dread other people's remarks.",female
552,JANE, Mama!,female
553,JANE," Well, I'm glad that's over. We can now meet as indifferent acquaintances.",female
554,JANE, You cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.,female
555,JANE," I'm sorry, though, that he came with Mr. Darcy.",female
556,JANE, Why ever not?,female
557,JANE, (stares) What do you mean?,female
558,JANE, Yes. A hundred times - yes.,female
559,JANE," Can you die of happiness? You know, he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!",female
560,JANE, He thought me indifferent!,female
561,JANE, No doubt poisoned by his pernicious sister.,female
562,JANE," Oh Lizzie, if I could but see you so happy. If there were such another man for you!",female
563,CAROLINE," Oh dear, we are a long way from Grosvenor Square, are we not, Mr Darcy?",female
564,CAROLINE," (puts down the letter) Apparently, -Lady Bathurst is redecorating her ballroom in the French style. A little unpatriotic, don't you think?",female
565,CAROLINE," Good Lord, Miss Bennet. Have you walked here?",female
566,CAROLINE," Goodness, did you see her petticoat? Six inches deep in mud!",female
567,CAROLINE," Oh yes, it's shocking to have a bad cold. I dislike excessively being ill myself.",female
568,CAROLINE," Stay!? She is a perfectly sweet girl but save being an excellent walker, there is very little to recommend her as a house-guest.",female
569,CAROLINE," The eldest Miss Bennet, as you know, I hold in excessive regard but as for the rest of them",female
570,CAROLINE, (cont'd) You do realise their uncle is in trade? In Cheapside?,female
571,CAROLINE," You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.",female
572,CAROLINE," How many letters you must have occasion to write, Mr Darcy. Letters of business too. How odious I should think them!",female
573,CAROLINE, Please tell your sister that I long to see her.,female
574,CAROLINE," I do dote on her, I was quite in raptures at her beautiful little design for a table.",female
575,CAROLINE," What do you mean, Charles?",female
576,CAROLINE," Nor I, to be sure!",female
577,CAROLINE," Absolutely. She must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing and the modern languages, to deserve the word. And something in her air and manner of walking.",female
578,CAROLINE," Miss Bennet, let us take a turn about the room.",female
579,CAROLINE," (cont'd) It's refreshing, is it not, after sitting so long in one attitude?",female
580,CAROLINE," Mr Darcy, will you join us?",female
581,CAROLINE," (to Lizzie, archly) What can he mean?",female
582,CAROLINE, (to Darcy) Please tell us!,female
583,CAROLINE," Oh, shocking! How shall we punish him for such a speech?",female
584,CAROLINE," Oh no, Mr Darcy is not to be teased! ",female
585,CAROLINE, (small smile) A family trait I think.,female
586,CAROLINE, Are we to receive every Bennet in the country?,female
587,CAROLINE, Indeed much more rational but rather less like a ball.,female
588,CAROLINE, Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.,female
589,CAROLINE," What interesting relatives you have, Miss Bennet.",female
590,CAROLINE, My dear Charles - you can't be serious.,female
591,CHARLOTTE," He is on the right, and on the left is his sister.",female
592,CHARLOTTE," That is his good friend, 'Mr Darcy.",female
593,CHARLOTTE," MiserabIe he may be, but poor he most certainly is not.",female
594,CHARLOTTE, Ten thousand a year and he owns half of Derbyshire.,female
595,CHARLOTTE," Count your blessings, Lizzie. If he liked you, you'd have to talk to him.",female
596,CHARLOTTE, Who's to inherit?,female
597,CHARLOTTE, But why?,female
598,CHARLOTTE," I dare say you will find him very amiable, Lizzie.",female
599,CHARLOTTE, She should move fast. Snap him up. There is plenty of time to get to know them after you're married.,female
600,CHARLOTTE," My dear Lizzie, I've come here to tell you the news. Mr Collins and I are engaged.",female
601,CHARLOTTE, Yes.,female
602,CHARLOTTE," Yes of course, Lizzie, what other kind of engaged is there?",female
603,CHARLOTTE," (cont'd) Oh for heavens sake, Lizzie, don't look at me like that. There's no earthly reason why I shouldn't be as happy with him as any other.",female
604,CHARLOTTE," Oh hush. Not all of us can afford to be romantic. I've been offered a comfortable home and protection, there's a lot to be thankful for.",female
605,CHARLOTTE," I'm twenty-seven years old. I'm plain and I have no money and no prospects. I'm already a burden to my parents and I'm frightened. So don't judge me, Lizzie, don't you dare judge me.",female
606,CHARLOTTE," My dear, I think our guest is tired after her journey.",female
607,CHARLOTTE," We shall not be disturbed here, this parlour is for my own particular use. (a beat). Oh Lizzie, it's such a pleasure, to run my own home!",female
608,CHARLOTTE, (jumps up) Has the pig escaped again?,female
609,CHARLOTTE," (cont'd) Oh! It's Lady Catherine. Come and see, Lizzie!",female
610,CHARLOTTE, Just put on whatever you've brought that's best.,female
611,CHARLOTTE," (eagerly) It' s very kind of you to ask us to dine, Lady Catherine.",female
612,CHARLOTTE, What on earth have you done to poor Mr Darcy?,female
613,CHARLOTTE, Lizzie!,female
614,CHARLOTTE, Lizzie! Are you alright?,female
615,BINGLEY," Not a good reader, you see. I prefer being out of doors. I mean, I can read, of course and, and I'm not suggesting you can't read outdoors - of course ",male
616,BINGLEY, That's exactly what I meant.,male
617,BINGLEY," Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld, but her sister Lizzie is very agreeable.",male
618,BINGLEY, (to Lizzie) Your friend Miss Lucas is a most amusing young woman.,male
619,BINGLEY, Miss Lizzie! Oh I'm so glad to see you,male
620,BINGLEY," She has a violent cold, but we shall get the better of it. I will have a bed made up for you. You must be our guest here until Jane recovers.",male
621,BINGLEY," It is a pleasure - I mean - not a pleasure that she's ill, of course not, but a pleasure that she's here - being ill.",male
622,BINGLEY, I thought she showed remarkable spirit coming all this way.,male
623,BINGLEY," (irritably) If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside it would not make them one jot less agreeable, Caroline.",male
624,BINGLEY," It's amazing, how young ladies have the patience to be so accomplished.",male
625,BINGLEY," They all paint tables, and embroider cushions and play the piano. I never heard of a young lady, but people say she is accomplished.",male
626,BINGLEY," Absolutely I find the country very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?",male
627,BINGLEY, A ball?,male
628,BINGLEY, When your sister has recovered you shall name the day.,male
629,BINGLEY," (to Mrs Bennet) Please let me show you to Jane, you will find her quite recovered.",male
630,BINGLEY," You're welcome anytime you feel the least bit poorly. I mean - you're welcome at any time, but not any less welcome if you know you're -",male
631,BINGLEY, Goodbye. Goodbye.,male
632,BINGLEY, I was on my way to your house.,male
633,BINGLEY," Of course you must come, Mr Wickham. Ladies, excuse me. Enjoy the day.",male
634,BINGLEY, You're here! I'm so pleased.,male
635,BINGLEY," How are you, Miss Elizabeth?",male
636,BINGLEY, (cont'd) Are you looking for someone?,male
637,BINGLEY," (smiles) I did hear of it, and offer my congratulations.",male
638,BINGLEY, Just a few weeks. For the shooting.,male
639,BINGLEY," She does indeed. Well, I must be going, I suppose. Darcy",male
640,BINGLEY," (cont' d) It was very pleasant to see you all again. Lizzie, Miss Jane..",male
641,BINGLEY," I know this is all very untoward, but I would like to request the privilege of speaking to Miss Jane",male
642,BINGLEY, First. I have to tell you that I have been an unmitigated and comprehensive ass.,male
643,DARCY, Not if I can help it.,female
644,DARCY, You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room.,female
645,DARCY," Perfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not handsome enough to tempt me.",female
646,DARCY," (cont' d) You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.",female
647,DARCY, I thought that poetry was the food of love.,female
648,DARCY," So what do you recommend, to encourage affection?",female
649,DARCY," (more kindly) She�s upstairs. (to footman) Show Miss Bennet the way, Alfred.",female
650,DARCY, I think her concern for her sister does her credit.,female
651,DARCY, (without looking up) You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.,female
652,DARCY," It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.",female
653,DARCY," I have already told her once, by your desire.",female
654,DARCY, Perhaps you will give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again. At present I have not enough room to do them justice.,female
655,DARCY," The word is indeed applied too liberally. I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen women, in all my acquaintance, that are truly accomplished.",female
656,DARCY, I do.,female
657,DARCY, And of course she must improve her mind by extensive reading.,female
658,DARCY, Are you so severe on your own sex?,female
659,DARCY," (shakes his head) You can only have two motives, Caroline, and I would interfere with either.",female
660,DARCY," Either you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage by walking. If the first, I should get in your way. If the second, I can admire you much better from here.",female
661,DARCY, That I couldn't say.,female
662,DARCY," Maybe, it's that I find it hard to forgive the follies and vices of others, or their offences against myself. My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.",female
663,DARCY, I find it perfectly adequate even if society is a little less varied than in town.,female
664,DARCY," May I have the next dance, Miss Elizabeth?",female
665,DARCY, Indeed. Most invigorating.,female
666,DARCY," I am perfectly happy to oblige, please advise me of what you would like most to hear.",female
667,DARCY, Do you talk as a rule while dancing?,female
668,DARCY," Tell me, do you and your sisters very of ten walk to Meryton?",female
669,DARCY, Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners he is sure of making friends - whether he is capable of retaining them is less certain.,female
670,DARCY, It is.,female
671,DARCY, (cont'd) Why do you ask such a question?,female
672,DARCY, And what have you discovered?,female
673,DARCY, I hope to afford you more clarity in the future.,female
674,DARCY, (bows ) Miss Elizabeth... I'm a guest here.,female
675,DARCY, She plays very well.,female
676,DARCY," I am well enough acquainted with you, Miss Bennet, to know I cannot alarm you even should I wish it.",female
677,DARCY, (colouring) I knew nobody beyond my own party.,female
678,DARCY, I do not have the talent of conversing easily with people I have never met before.,female
679,DARCY, This is a charming house. I believe my aunt did a great deal to it when Mr Collins first arrived.,female
680,DARCY, Mr Collins seems very fortunate in his choice of wife.,female
681,DARCY, No. Thank you.,female
682,DARCY," (cont'd) Good day, Miss Bennet. It's been a pleasure.",female
683,DARCY," Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but I can bear it no longer... The past months have been a torment...",female
684,DARCY, (cont'd) I came to Rosings with the single object of seeing you...l had to see you,female
685,DARCY," l've fought against my better judgement, my family's expectation. . .",female
686,DARCY, (cont'd) The inferiority of your birth. . .my rank and circumstance.. ( stumblingly) all those things.. .but I'm willing to put them aside.. .and ask you to end my agony...,female
687,DARCY, (with passion) I love you. Most ardently.,female
688,DARCY, (cont'd) Please do me the honour of accepting my hand.,female
689,DARCY, (stares) Is this your reply?,female
690,DARCY, Are you laughing at me?,female
691,DARCY, Are you rejecting me?,female
692,DARCY," Might I ask why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus repulsed?",female
693,DARCY," Believe me, I didn't mean",female
694,DARCY, What reasons?,female
695,DARCY, I do not deny it.,female
696,DARCY, Because I believed your sister indifferent to him.,female
697,DARCY," I watched them most carefully, and realized his attachment was much deeper than hers.",female
698,DARCY," Bingley too is modest, and was persuaded that she didn't feel strongly for him.",female
699,DARCY, I did it for his own good.,female
700,DARCY, ( sharply) No! I wouldn't do your sister the dishonour. Though it was suggested (stops),female
701,DARCY, It was made perfectly clear that.. .an advantageous marriage. . . (stops),female
702,DARCY, No!,female
703,DARCY," (cont'd) There was, however, I have to admit... the matter of your family.",female
704,DARCY," No, it was more than that.",female
705,DARCY," (pause, very uncomfortable) It pains me to say this, but it was the lack of propriety shown by your mother, your three younger sisters - even, on occasion, your father. Forgive me.",female
706,DARCY, (cont'd) You and your sister - I must exclude from this...,female
707,DARCY, Mr Wickham?,female
708,DARCY, You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns!,female
709,DARCY," Oh yes, his misfortunes have been very great indeed!",female
710,DARCY," So this is your opinion of me! Thank you for explaining so fully. Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked, if your pride had not been hurt -",female
711,DARCY, - by my honesty in admitting scruples about our relationship. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances?,female
712,DARCY," Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much of your time.",female
713,DARCY, I came to leave you this.,female
714,DARCY," (cont'd) I shall not renew the sentiments which were so disgusting to you, but if I may, I will address the two offences you have laid against me.",female
715,DARCY, (cont'd) My father provided for Mr Wickham a valuable living.,female
716,DARCY," (V.O.) (cont'd) But upon his death, however, Mr Wickham told me that he had no intention of taking orders and would I recompense him to the tune of 3000 pounds so he could go to town and study the law.",female
717,DARCY," (V.O.) (cont'd) This I did, though by now I had some doubts about his character. These were confirmed by reports that he had sunk into a life of idleness, gambling and dissipation. The money was soon used up, whereupon he wrote demanding more money which I refused, after which he severed all acquaintance -",female
718,DARCY, (V.O.) (cont'd) But last summer he unwillingly obtruded on my notice when he connived a relationship with my sister whom he attempted to persuade to elope with him. His objective was her inheritance of thirty thousand pounds. She was fifteen.,female
719,DARCY," (V.0.) As to the other matter, that of your sister and Mr Bingley. Though the motives which governed me may to you appear insufficient, they were in the service of a friend.",female
720,DARCY, Miss Bennet!,female
721,DARCY, (stupidly) No? I'm not.,female
722,DARCY, - some business with my steward -.,female
723,DARCY, (trying to recover) And are you having a pleasant trip?,female
724,DARCY, Tomorrow? (disappointed). Are you staying at Lambton?,female
725,DARCY, May I see you to the village?,female
726,DARCY," Yes. Yes, I know.",female
727,DARCY, I shall send my carriage at noon,female
728,DARCY," My sister, Miss Georgiana...",female
729,DARCY, Yes I should.,female
730,DARCY," She's easily persuaded, is she not?",female
731,DARCY," I said played ""quite well"".",female
732,DARCY," Your uncle is fond of fishing, I hear.",female
733,DARCY, Can you persuade him to borrow a rod this afternoon? For the lake here is very well stocked and its occupants left in peace for far too long.,female
734,DARCY, I have recently thought a great deal about how I appear and act to others.,female
735,DARCY, (quietly to Lizzie) This is my fault - if only I had exposed Wickham when I should.,female
736,DARCY, Would I could help you.,female
737,DARCY, This is grave indeed. I will leave you. Goodbye.,female
738,DARCY," Quite well, thank you.",female
739,DARCY, I return to town tomorrow.,female
740,DARCY, What were you thinking of?,female
741,DARCY, Nor I. My aunt?,female
742,DARCY, How can I ever make amends for such behavior?,female
743,DARCY," You must know - surely you must know, that it was all for you.",female
744,DARCY," (cont' d) You are too generous to trifle with me. I believe you spoke with my Aunt last night, and it has taught me to hope as I had scarcely allowed myself before. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me forever.",female
745,DARCY," (cont'd) If, however, your feelings have changed. .",female
746,DARCY," (cont' d) I could, I would have to tell you, you have bewitched me body and soul and I love and love and love you. And never wish to be parted from you from this day on.",female
747,DARCY," And how are you today, my dear?",female
748,DARCY, Why?,female
749,DARCY, What endearments am I allowed?,female
750,DARCY, And what shall I call you when I'm cross? Mrs. Darcy? ,female
751,DARCY, And how are you this morning Mrs. Darcy?,female
752,MR COLLINS," (deep bow ) Mr Collins, at your service.",male
753,MR COLLINS," What a blessing.l am honoured to have, as my patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourg, you have heard of her, I presume?",male
754,MR COLLINS," (cont'd) My small rectory abuts her estate, Rosings Park, and she of ten condescends to drive by my humble dwelling in her little phaeton and ponies.",male
755,MR COLLINS," One daughter, the heiress of it all and a creature of such superior graces she seems born to greatness. (little cough) These are the kind of little, delicate compliments that are always acceptable to ladies, and which I conceive myself particularly bound to pay.",male
756,MR COLLINS," They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with arranging such little elegant compliments, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible.",male
757,MR COLLINS," After dinner I thought I might read to you all for an hour or two. I have with me Fordyce's sermons, which speak eloquently on all matters moral. (to Jane) Do you know Fordyce's sermons Miss Bennet?",male
758,MR COLLINS, Mrs Bennet. You do know I have been bestowed by the good grace of Lady Catherine de Bourg a parsonage of no mean size.,male
759,MR COLLINS," Well, it is my avowed hope that soon I may find a mistress for it, and I have to inform you that the eldest Miss Bennet has captured my special attention.",male
760,MR COLLINS, Engaged!,male
761,MR COLLINS, Indeed. Indeed. A very agreeable alternative.,male
762,MR COLLINS, There you are.,male
763,MR COLLINS, I do not consider it incompatible with the office of a clergyman to indulge in such an innocent diversion.,male
764,MR COLLINS," (cont'd) In fact several people, her ladyship included, have complimented me on my lightness of foot.",male
765,MR COLLINS," To be sure/ dancing is of little consequence to me, but it does afford the opportunity to lavish one's partner with delicate attentions which is my primary object of the evening.",male
766,MR COLLINS," It is my intention, if I may be so bold to remain close to you throughout the evening.",male
767,MR COLLINS," Is that Mr Darcy, of Pemberley in Derbyshire?",male
768,MR COLLINS, But I must make myself known to him immediately!,male
769,MR COLLINS," He is the nephew of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine.",male
770,MR COLLINS, Mr Darcy!,male
771,MR COLLINS," Mrs Bennet - I was hoping, if it would not trouble you, that I might solicit a private audience with Miss Lizzie in the course of the morning.",male
772,MR COLLINS," Dear Miss Elizabeth, 1 am sure my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.",male
773,MR COLLINS, And that no reproach on the subject of fortune will cross my lips once we are married.,male
774,MR COLLINS," (unperturbed) I must add, that Lady Catherine will thoroughly approve, when I speak to her of your modesty, economy and other amiable qualities.",male
775,MR COLLINS," (pause) I flatter myself, cousin, that your refusal is merely a natural delicacy. And as it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made to you.",male
776,MR COLLINS," I must conclude that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.",male
777,MR COLLINS, Head strong?,male
778,MR COLLINS," My wife encourages me to spend as much time in the garden as possible, for the sake of my health.",male
779,MR COLLINS," (cont'd) I plan many improvements, of course. I intend to throw out a bow and plant a lime walk. (sharp look at Lizzie) Oh yes, I flatter myself that any young lady would be happy to be the mistress of such a house.",male
780,MR COLLINS, (OOV) Charlotte!,male
781,MR COLLINS, Great news! Great news! We have an invitation to visit Rosings this evening from Lady Catherine de Bourg.,male
782,MR COLLINS," Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.",male
783,MR COLLINS, Lady Catherine has never been averse to the truly humble.,male
784,MR COLLINS," One of the most extraordinary sights in all Europe, is it not. The glazing alone cost upwards of twenty thousand pounds.",male
785,MR COLLINS, Your Ladyship. (to the daughter) Miss de Bourg.,male
786,MR COLLINS, (whispers to Lizzie) The chimneypiece alone cost 400 pounds.,male
787,MR COLLINS, Mr Darcy! (another deep bow). I had no idea we would have the honour...,male
788,MR COLLINS, (whispering) You know Mr Darcy is as good as engaged to Miss de Bourg?,male
789,MR COLLINS," (hisses) Come come, Lizzie, her ladyship demands it!",male
790,MR COLLINS, (popping his head around the door) Come on. We shall be late!,male
791,WICKHAM, An enchanted lieutenant.,male
792,WICKHAM, Shall we all look for some ribbon together?,male
793,WICKHAM, I shan't even browse. I can't be trusted. I have very poor taste in ribbons.,male
794,WICKHAM," No, it's true. And buckles. When it comes to buckles, I'm lost.",male
795,WICKHAM, A laughing-stock.,male
796,WICKHAM," Ignore me. I'm of next to no importance, so it's easily done.",male
797,WICKHAM, Allow me to oblige.,male
798,WICKHAM," Take that, you cur! And that, and that!",male
799,WICKHAM," Oh so do I. Miserable bunch. Small, swarthy and that tinvEmperor.",male
800,WICKHAM, Ah. Perhaps. How long has Mr Darcy been a guest there?,male
801,WICKHAM," Indeed, I have been connected with his family since infancy.",male
802,WICKHAM," (cont'd) You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, especially given our cold greeting this afternoon.",male
803,WICKHAM," Oh no - it is not for me to be driven away. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go not I.",male
804,WICKHAM, Do you really want to hear?,male
805,WICKHAM," My father managed his estate. We grew up together, Darcy and I. His father treated me like a second son. Oh he was the kindest of men and bequeathed me the best living in his gift, for I had my heart set on joining the church. But when he died Darcy ignored his wishes and gave the living to another man.",male
806,WICKHAM," Out of jealousy, for his father loved me more than he loved him.",male
807,WICKHAM," (nods) And out of pride, for he considered me too lowly to be worth his consideration.",male
808,WICKHAM," I've been enlisted in a regiment in the north of England, sir.",male
809,WICKHAM, Near Newcastle. We shall travel there next week.,male
810,WICKHAM," I hope we can be even better friends, now we're brother and sister.",male
811,WICKHAM, (cont'd) I hear you visited Pemberley. My dear old home.,male
812,WICKHAM, (a beat) Did you like her?,male
813,WICKHAM, (to Lizzie) I hope we'll have the pleasure?,male
814,LADY CATHERINE, So you are Elizabeth Bennet.,female
815,LADY CATHERINE, (looking her up and down) Hmm. (indicates her daughter) This is my daughter.,female
816,LADY CATHERINE, (surprised and not delighted) You know my nephew?,female
817,LADY CATHERINE," Mr Collins! You can't sit next to your wife, get up. Move over there.",female
818,LADY CATHERINE," Do you play the pianoforte, Miss Bennet?",female
819,LADY CATHERINE, Oh. Do you draw?,female
820,LADY CATHERINE," Your sisters, do they draw?",female
821,LADY CATHERINE, Has your governess left you?,female
822,LADY CATHERINE," No governess? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess, I never heard such a thing! Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.",female
823,LADY CATHERINE, Mmmm. Are any of your younger sisters out in society?,female
824,LADY CATHERINE," All! What, five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second the younger ones out before the elders are married! Your youngest sisters must be very young.",female
825,LADY CATHERINE," Upon my word, you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?",female
826,LADY CATHERINE," Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us!",female
827,LADY CATHERINE," Music is my delight. In fact there are few people in England who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a prodigy. (indicates daughter) So would Anne, if her health would have allowed her.",female
828,LADY CATHERINE," How does Georgiana get along, Darcy?",female
829,LADY CATHERINE, I hope she practises. No excellence can be acquired without constant practice. I have told Mrs Collins this. (turns to Charlotte) Though you have no instrument of your own you are very welcome to come to Rosings and play on the piano in the housekeeper's room. ,female
830,LADY CATHERINE, Fitzwilliam! I need you!,female
831,LADY CATHERINE," The rest of your offspring, I presume.",female
832,LADY CATHERINE," You have a very small garden, madam.",female
833,LADY CATHERINE," Absolutely not! I must speak to Miss Elizabeth alone, as a matter of urgency.",female
834,LADY CATHERINE," You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand why I am here.",female
835,LADY CATHERINE," Miss Bennet, I warn you, I am not to be trifled with. A report of a most alarming nature has reached me that you intend to be united with my nephew, Mr. Darcy.",female
836,LADY CATHERINE," To hear it contradicted, Miss Bennet.",female
837,LADY CATHERINE, If? Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourself?,female
838,LADY CATHERINE, And can you declare there is no foundation for it?,female
839,LADY CATHERINE, This is not to be borne. Has my nephew made you an offer of marriage?,female
840,LADY CATHERINE, Let me be understood. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?,female
841,LADY CATHERINE," Oh, obstinate girl! This union has been planned since their infancy. Do you think it can be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth and whose own sister's elopement resulted in the scandalously patched-up marriage, only achieved at the expense of your uncle? Heaven and earth, are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted? Now tell me once and for all, are you engaged to him?",female
842,LADY CATHERINE, And will you promise never to enter into such an engagement?,female
843,LADY CATHERINE, I have never been thus treated in my entire life.,female
844,MRS GARDINER," Lizzie dear, you would be very welcome to accompany us?",female
845,MRS GARDINER," Take care, my love, that savors strongly of bitterness.",female
846,MRS GARDINER, Pemberley?,female
847,MRS GARDINER," well, we shall go there tomorrow, Lizzie.",female
848,MRS GARDINER, Stay here?,female
849,MRS GARDINER, But you liked Haddon. You liked those damask velvet drapes and you liked -,female
850,MRS GARDINER, Imagine being mistress of all this. It is as big as all Cheapside.,female
851,MRS GARDINER, (to Lizzie) Keep up.,female
852,MRS GARDINER," If he should marry, you might see more of him.",female
853,MRS GARDINER," A handsome face. Lizzie, is it a true likeness of him?",female
854,MRS GARDINER," Lizzie, I've just met Mr. Darcy! Why didn't you tell us you had seen him? He's asked us to dine with him tomorrow - He was very civil, was he not?",female
855,MRS GARDINER, Not at all like you painted him.,female
856,MRS GARDINER," - there is something pleasing about his mouth, when he speaks.",female
857,MRS GARDINER, He particularly wishes you to meet his sister.,female
858,MRS GARDINER, Thank you so much Mr. Darcy.,female
859,MRS GARDINER, Nearly.,female
860,MRS GARDINER, Has anything been done to recover her?,female
