5,FURY, We should tell them to go back to sleep?,4,male
6,FURY, I need you to make sure the Phase Two prototypes are shipped out.,4,male
7,FURY, Until such time as the world ends we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of Phase Two on a truck and gone.,4,male
8,FURY," Talk to me, Doctor.",4,male
9,FURY, Is there anything we know for certain?,4,male
10,FURY, Is that supposed to be funny?,4,male
11,FURY, How soon can you pull the plug?,4,male
12,FURY," We prepared for this, Doctor. Harnessing energy from space.",4,male
13,FURY, That can be harmful. Where’s agent Barton?,4,male
14,FURY, Agent Barton. Report.,4,male
15,FURY, Have you seen anything that might set this thing off?,4,male
16,FURY, At this end?,4,male
17,FURY," Sir, please put down the spear!",4,male
18,FURY, This doesn’t have to get any messier.,4,male
19,FURY, We have no quarrel with your people.,4,male
20,FURY, You planning to step on us?,4,male
21,FURY, Free from what?,4,male
22,FURY," Yeah, you say peace. I kinda think you mean the other thing.",4,male
23,FURY, Like the pharaohs of old.,4,male
24,FURY, Hill!,4,male
25,FURY, Do you copy?,4,male
26,FURY, Barton...has turned.,4,male
27,FURY, Get the Tesseract. Shut them down.,4,male
28,FURY, The Tesseract is with a hostile force. I have men down. Hill?,4,male
29,FURY, Sound a general call. I want every living soul...,4,male
30,FURY, ...not working rescue looking for that briefcase.,4,male
31,FURY," Coulson, get back to base.",4,male
32,FURY, This is a level seven.,4,male
33,FURY, As of right now...,4,male
34,FURY, We are at war.,4,male
35,FURY," You ever been in a war, councilman? In a fire fight? Did you feel an over abundance of control?",4,male
36,FURY," Not Asgard, Loki.",4,male
37,FURY, Our intelligence says Thor is not a hostile. But he’s worlds away and we can’t depend on him to help either. It’s up to us.,4,male
38,FURY, Phase Two isn’t ready; our enemy is. We need a response team.,4,male
39,FURY, This isn’t about the Avengers.,4,male
40,FURY," I’m not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people may be isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe, with the right push, they can be exactly what we need.",4,male
41,FURY," No, It’s won by soldiers.",4,male
42,FURY, Trouble sleeping?,4,male
43,FURY," Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.",4,male
44,FURY," We’ve made some mistakes along the way, some very recently.",4,male
45,FURY, I am.,4,male
46,FURY, Trying to save it.,4,male
47,FURY, Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think. The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That’s something the world sorely needs.,4,male
48,FURY, He’s called Loki. He’s- not from around here. There’s a lot we’ll have to bring you up to speed on if you’re in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.,4,male
49,FURY, Ten bucks says you’re wrong. There’s a debriefing packet waiting for you back at your apartment. Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?,4,male
50,FURY, Good! Let’s vanish.,4,male
51,FURY," Gentlemen. Doctor, thank you for coming.",4,male
52,FURY," Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you’re in the wind.",4,male
53,FURY, How many are there?,4,male
54,FURY," Agent Romanoff, would you show Doctor Banner to his laboratory, please?",4,male
55,FURY," Hill, did you tell the council that Barton had been compromised?",4,male
56,FURY, Doesn’t appear that I have to.,4,male
57,FURY," Captain, you’re up.",4,male
58,FURY, He saying anything?,4,male
59,FURY," Just get him here, we’re low on time.",4,male
60,FURY," In case it’s unclear, you try to escape- you so much as scratch that glass- Thirty thousand feet straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works? Ant. (gestures to panel) Boot.",4,male
61,FURY, Built for something a lot stronger than you.,4,male
62,FURY," Well, let me know if ’real power’ wants a magazine or something.",4,male
63,FURY, Doctor Banner is only here to track the Cube. I was hoping you might join him.,4,male
64,FURY," I don’t know about that, but it is powered by the Cube. And I like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.",4,male
65,FURY, War hasn’t started yet. You think you can make Loki tell us where the Tesseract is?,4,male
66,FURY," A lot of guys think that, until the pain starts.",4,male
67,FURY," I’m asking, what are you prepared to do?",4,male
68,FURY, Then why do I feel like he’s the only person on this boat that wants to be here?,4,male
69,FURY," What are you doing, Mr. Stark?",4,male
70,FURY, You’re supposed to be locating the Tesseract.,4,male
71,FURY," Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we’re-",4,male
72,FURY, Because of him.,4,male
73,FURY," Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly- hilariously, out-gunned.",4,male
74,FURY," But you’re not the only people out there, are you? And, you’re not the only threat. The world’s filling up with people who can’t be matched, they can’t be controlled.",4,male
75,FURY, You forced our hand! We had to come up with some-,4,male
76,FURY," Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?",4,male
77,FURY, You need to step away.,4,male
78,FURY," Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr. Banner back to his-",4,male
79,FURY, The cell was just-,4,male
80,FURY, Got it!,4,male
81,FURY, Hill!,4,male
82,FURY," Stark, you copy that?",4,male
83,FURY," Coulson, initiate defensive lock down in the contingent center. Then get to the armory.",4,male
84,FURY, Romanoff!,4,male
85,FURY, Bring the carrier to a one-eight-zero south. Take us to the water.,4,male
86,FURY, Is the sun coming up?,4,male
87,FURY, Then put us on the left. Get us over water. One more turbine goes down then we drop.,4,male
88,FURY, We need full evac on the lower hangar bed.,4,male
89,FURY, Get his attention.,4,male
90,FURY, They are not getting through here so what the-,4,male
91,FURY," It’s Barton, he took out our systems. He’s headed for the detention lab. Does anybody copy?",4,male
92,FURY," Stark, we’re losing altitude.",4,male
93,FURY, Just stay awake. Eyes on me.,4,male
94,FURY, Not an option.,4,male
95,FURY, Agent Coulson is down.,4,male
96,FURY, They’re here.,4,male
97,FURY, They called it.,4,male
98,FURY," These were in Phil Coulson’s jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them. We’re dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Think I had that coming. Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number, though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called the Avengers Initiative. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes. Well, it’s an old fashioned notion.",4,male
99,FURY, Agent Hill.,4,male
100,FURY, They needed the push.,4,male
101,FURY," They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything.",4,male
102,FURY," I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it’s a stupid ass decision, I’ve elected to ignore it.",4,male
103,FURY," Until I’m certain my team can’t hold it, I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population.",4,male
104,FURY," I’d send that bird out, we already have.",4,male
105,FURY," Stark, you hear me? You have a missile headed straight for the city.",4,male
106,FURY, Three minutes. Max. Stay load can wipe out mid-town.,4,male
107,FURY, I’m not currently tracking their whereabouts. I’d say they’ve earned a leave of absence.,4,male
108,FURY, I didn’t make it. I just didn’t argue with the god that did.,4,male
109,FURY, Every world knows it!,4,male
110,FURY, They’ll come back!,4,male
111,FURY, I am.,4,male
112,FURY, Because we’ll need them to.,4,male
113,AGENT COULSON," That’s the problem, sir. We don’t know.",4,male
114,AGENT COULSON, ...energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.,4,male
115,AGENT COULSON, He wasn’t testing it. He wasn’t even in the room. Spontaneous event.,4,male
116,AGENT COULSON, Climbing. When Selvig couldn’t shut it down we ordered evac.,4,male
117,AGENT COULSON, Campus should be clear in the next half hour.,4,male
118,AGENT COULSON," Let’s just go. No-no-no! Leave it, leave it. GO!",4,male
119,AGENT COULSON," We’re clear upstairs, sir...",4,male
120,AGENT COULSON, Director.,4,male
121,AGENT COULSON, What do we do?,4,male
122,AGENT COULSON, This takes precedence.,4,male
123,AGENT COULSON, Natasha...Barton’s been compromised.,4,male
124,AGENT COULSON, We don’t know.,4,male
125,AGENT COULSON," We think so. We’ll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.",4,male
126,AGENT COULSON, Oh I’ve got Stark! You get the big guy.,4,male
127,AGENT COULSON," Mr. Stark, we need to talk.",4,male
128,AGENT COULSON, This is urgent.,4,male
129,AGENT COULSON, I can’t stay.,4,male
130,AGENT COULSON," We need you to look this over, as soon as possible.",4,male
131,AGENT COULSON, This isn’t a consultation.,4,male
132,AGENT COULSON, This isn’t about personality profiles anymore.,4,male
133,AGENT COULSON, I can drop you off.,4,male
134,AGENT COULSON, A lot of people were. You were the world’s first superhero. Banner thought Gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine’s original formula.,4,male
135,AGENT COULSON," Not so much. When he’s not that thing though, guy’s like a Stephen Hawking. He’s like a- smart person. I gotta say- it’s an honor to meet you, officially. I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping. I mean, I was, I was present, while you were unconscious from-the-ice.",4,male
136,AGENT COULSON," Oh you are, absolutely. Ah- we made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input.",4,male
137,AGENT COULSON," Everything that’s happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old-fashioned.",4,male
138,AGENT COULSON, Agent Romanoff- Captain Rogers.,4,male
139,AGENT COULSON, See you there.,4,male
140,AGENT COULSON," We’re sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cell phones... ...laptops, if it’s connected to a satellite, it’s eyes and ears for us.",4,male
141,AGENT COULSON," I mean, if it’s not too much trouble.",4,male
142,AGENT COULSON," It’s a vintage set. Took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges but-",4,male
143,AGENT COULSON, Location?,4,male
144,AGENT COULSON," ...moved Jane Foster. We’ve got an excellent observatory in Tromsø. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She’ll be safe.",4,male
145,AGENT COULSON, He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here.,4,male
146,AGENT COULSON, Like what?,4,male
147,AGENT COULSON, No.,4,male
148,AGENT COULSON, Move away please. Do you like this? We started working on the prototype after you sent the Destroyer. Even I don’t know what it does. Do you wanna find out?,4,male
149,AGENT COULSON, You’re going to lose.,4,male
150,AGENT COULSON," It’s in your nature,",4,male
151,AGENT COULSON, You lack conviction.,4,male
152,AGENT COULSON, So that’s what it does.,4,male
153,AGENT COULSON, I’m sorry boss. They got rabbited.,4,male
154,AGENT COULSON, Oh I’m clockin’ out here.,4,male
155,AGENT COULSON," It’s okay, boss. This was never gonna work- if they didn’t have something- to",4,male
156,MARIA HILL," Sir, evacuation may be futile.",4,female
157,MARIA HILL, If we can’t control the Tesseract’s energy there may not be a minimum safe distance.,4,female
158,MARIA HILL," Sir, is that really a priority right now?",4,female
159,MARIA HILL," Yes, Sir. With me.",4,female
160,MARIA HILL, Who’s that?,4,female
161,MARIA HILL, A lot of men still under. Don’t know how many survivors.,4,female
162,MARIA HILL, Roger that.,4,female
163,MARIA HILL," All engines operating. SHIELD emergency protocol one nine three point six in effect. We’re at level, sir.",4,female
164,MARIA HILL, Engage retro reflection panels.,4,female
165,MARIA HILL, Was that not procedure?,4,female
166,MARIA HILL, He turns!,4,female
167,MARIA HILL, When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?,4,female
168,MARIA HILL, Number Three engine is down.,4,female
169,MARIA HILL, Did we get a run in? Talk to me.,4,female
170,MARIA HILL, We lose one more engine we won’t be. Somebody’s gotta get outside and patch that engine.,4,female
171,MARIA HILL, GRENADE!,4,female
172,MARIA HILL," Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!",4,female
173,MARIA HILL," Escort 6-Oh, proceed to Wishbone and...",4,female
174,MARIA HILL, ...engage hostile. Don’t get too close.,4,female
175,MARIA HILL, Sir.,4,female
176,MARIA HILL," Those cards, they were in Coulson’s locker, not in his jacket.",4,female
177,MARIA HILL," Yes, sir.",4,female
178,MARIA HILL, Sir. The council is on.,4,female
179,MARIA HILL," SIR, WE HAVE A BIRD IN MOTION! Anyone on the deck we have a rogue bird. We need to shut it down! Repeat, takeoff is not authorized!",4,female
180,MARIA HILL," ...They’ve gone their separate ways, some pretty extremely far. get into a situation like this again, what happens then?",4,female
181,MARIA HILL, Really sure about that?,4,female
182,MARIA HILL, Why?,4,female
183,SELVIG, Director.,4,male
184,SELVIG, The Tesseract is misbehaving.,4,male
185,SELVIG," No, it’s not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she’s misbehaving.",4,male
186,SELVIG," She’s an energy source. We turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level-",4,male
187,SELVIG," We don’t have the harness. My calculations are far from complete. She’s throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of Gamma radiation.",4,male
188,SELVIG," The hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.",4,male
189,SELVIG, What’s that?,4,male
190,SELVIG," Loki, brother of Thor?",4,male
191,SELVIG, He’s right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. We’ve got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.,4,male
192,SELVIG, Put it over there. Where did you find all these people?,4,male
193,SELVIG," Yeah. Iridium. It’s found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It’s very hard to get hold of.",4,male
194,SELVIG," Well, I didn’t know. Hey! This is wonderful. The Tesseract has shown me so much. It’s- it’s more than knowledge, it’s truth.",4,male
195,SELVIG," Stick in the mud. He’s got no soul. No wonder you chose this, this tomb to work in.",4,male
196,SELVIG," Loki’s scepter, the energy- the Tesseract can’t fight. You can’t protect against yourself.",4,male
197,SELVIG," Well, actually I think I did. I built in a safety to cut the power source.",4,male
198,SELVIG, It may be able to close the portal. And I’m looking right at it.,4,male
199,SELVIG, Right at the crown!,4,male
200,BARTON, I see better from a distance.,4,male
201,BARTON," No one’s come and gone. And Selvig’s clean. No contacts, no IM. If there’s any tampering, sir, it wasn’t this end.",4,male
202,BARTON," Yeah. The Cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right?  Doors open from both sides.",4,male
203,BARTON," Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow and drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us.",4,male
204,BARTON, We need this vehicles.,4,male
205,BARTON, Didn’t tell me.,4,male
206,BARTON," SHIELD has no shortage of enemies, Doctor. This the stuff you need?",4,male
207,BARTON, Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.,4,male
208,BARTON, My next target.,4,male
209,BARTON," Well, the Radisson doesn’t have three levels of lead lined flooring between SHIELD and that Cube.",4,male
210,BARTON," You’re going to have to contend with him sir. As long as he’s in the air, I can’t pin him down. And he’ll be putting together a team.",4,male
211,BARTON," To each other more than likely. But if Fury can get ’em on track, and he might, they could throw some noise our way.",4,male
212,BARTON, He’s got a clear line of sight.,4,male
213,BARTON," It might be. I was disoriented, and I’m not at my best with a gun.",4,male
214,BARTON, That’s a risk,4,male
215,BARTON, If you’re set on making yourself known. I could be useful.,4,male
216,BARTON, I need a distraction. And an eyeball.,4,male
217,BARTON," Keep that engine down. Detention, wait for camera to go dark. Stay close.",4,male
218,BARTON, Natasha!,4,male
219,BARTON, You know that? Is that what you know? I gotta go in though. I have to flush him out.,4,male
220,BARTON, You don’t understand. Have you ever had someone take your brain and play? Pull you out and stuff something else in? You know what it’s like to be unmade?,4,male
221,BARTON, Why am I back? How did you get him out?,4,male
222,BARTON," Thanks. Natasha, how many agents?",4,male
223,BARTON, Loki. He get away?,4,male
224,BARTON, Didn’t need to know. Didn’t ask. He’s gonna make his play soon though. Today.,4,male
225,BARTON, Yeah? Who’s we?,4,male
226,BARTON," Well, if I put an arrow through Loki’s eye socket I’d sleep better I suppose.",4,male
227,BARTON," But you don’t. You’re a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you?",4,male
228,BARTON, Natasha.,4,male
229,BARTON, I can.,4,male
230,BARTON, Yeah.,4,male
231,BARTON, Nat!,4,male
232,BARTON, We’ve got civilians trapped.,4,male
233,BARTON," Captain, it would be my genuine pleasure.",4,male
234,BARTON, You and I remember Budapest very differently.,4,male
235,BARTON, Oh yeah! Get in line.,4,male
236,BARTON, Wanna give me a lift?,4,male
237,BARTON, Stark. You gotta lot of strays on your tail.,4,male
238,BARTON, Well they can’t bank worth a damn.,4,male
239,BARTON," Well, Thor’s taking out a squadron down on 6th.",4,male
240,BARTON," Captain, the bank on 42nd, past Madison. They cornered a lot of civilians in there.",4,male
241,BARTON," Nat, what are you doing?",4,male
242,BARTON, I got it.,4,male
243,LOKI, You have heart.,4,male
244,LOKI, Please don’t. I still need that.,4,male
245,LOKI," Of course it does. I’ve come too far for anything else. I am Loki, of Asgard. And I am burdened with glorious purpose.",4,male
246,LOKI, An ant has no quarrel with a boot.,4,male
247,LOKI," I come with glad tidings, of a world made free.",4,male
248,LOKI," Freedom. Freedom is life’s great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart- -you will know peace.",4,male
249,LOKI, Well then.,4,male
250,LOKI, Let them goad themselves. I will lead them in a glorious battle.,4,male
251,LOKI, Glorious not lengthy- if your force is as formidable as you claim.,4,male
252,LOKI," I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard, betrayed.",4,male
253,LOKI," You don’t have the Tesseract yet. I don’t threaten. But until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words.",4,male
254,LOKI," I know. It, ah- it touches everyone differently. What did it show you Agent Barton?",4,male
255,LOKI, I see why Fury chose you to guard it.,4,male
256,LOKI, Are they a threat?,4,male
257,LOKI, You admire Fury.,4,male
258,LOKI, Is that why you failed to kill him?,4,male
259,LOKI," I want to know everything you can tell me about this team of his. I would- test their mettle. I am weary of scuttling in shadow. I mean to rule this world, not burrow in it.",4,male
260,LOKI, Oh yes.,4,male
261,LOKI, Tell me what you need.,4,male
262,LOKI," Kneel before me. I said- KNEEL! Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It’s the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life’s joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made- to be ruled. In the end- you will always kneel.",4,male
263,LOKI, There are no men like me.,4,male
264,LOKI," Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example.",4,male
265,LOKI, The soldier- -the man out of time.,4,male
266,LOKI, Kneel!,4,male
267,LOKI, I’m not overly fond of what follows.,4,male
268,LOKI," Oh-ho, I missed you too.",4,male
269,LOKI," Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone, how many dark energy did the All-Father  have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth.",4,male
270,LOKI, Did you mourn?,4,male
271,LOKI," Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?",4,male
272,LOKI," I remember a shadow, living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me  into an abyss. I who was and should be king!",4,male
273,LOKI, Well yes.,4,male
274,LOKI," I’ve seen worlds you’ve never known about. I have grown, Odinson, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it-",4,male
275,LOKI, I am a king!,4,male
276,LOKI, I don’t have it. You need the Cube to bring me home but I’ve sent it off I know not where.,4,male
277,LOKI, I’m listening?,4,male
278,LOKI," It’s an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me.",4,male
279,LOKI," Oh I’ve heard. (turns to a camera)... ...A mindless beast- makes play he’s still a man... ...How desperate are you, that you call on such lost creatures to defend you?",4,male
280,LOKI," Ooh. It burns you to have come so close, to have the Tesseract, to have power- unlimited power, and for what? (smiles and faces the camera) A... ...warm light for all mankind to share? And then to be reminded what real power is.",4,male
281,LOKI, Hm. There’s not many people that can sneak up on me.,4,male
282,LOKI," After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate.",4,male
283,LOKI, I’d say I’ve expanded his mind.,4,male
284,LOKI," Is this love, Agent Romanoff?",4,male
285,LOKI, Tell me.,4,male
286,LOKI, And what will you do if I vow to spare him?,4,male
287,LOKI," Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man?",4,male
288,LOKI, And what are you now?,4,male
289,LOKI," Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? Drakov’s daughter? Sao Paulo? The hospital fire? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it’s gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child, a prayer. Pathetic",4,male
290,LOKI," I won’t touch Barton! Not until I make him kill you. Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear. And then he’ll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams I’ll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim!",4,male
291,LOKI," Oh, no. You brought the monster.",4,male
292,LOKI, What?,4,male
293,LOKI, Are you ever not going to fall for that?,4,male
294,LOKI, The humans think us immortal. Shall we test that?,4,male
295,LOKI, Am I?,4,male
296,LOKI," your heroes are scattered, your floating fortress falls from the sky. Where is my disadvantage?",4,male
297,LOKI, I don’t think I-,4,male
298,LOKI, Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity.,4,male
299,LOKI, You should have left your armor on for that.,4,male
300,LOKI, Stalling me won’t change anything.,4,male
301,LOKI," The Chitauri are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear?",4,male
302,LOKI," Yes, I’m met them.",4,male
303,LOKI, That was the plan.,4,male
304,LOKI, I have an army.,4,male
305,LOKI," Oh, I thought the beast had wandered off.",4,male
306,LOKI," How will your friends have time for me, when they’re so busy fighting you? This usually works.",4,male
307,LOKI, You will all fall before me.,4,male
308,LOKI, You can’t. There is no stopping it. There is only the war!,4,male
309,LOKI, It’s too late. It’s too late to stop it.,4,male
310,LOKI, Sentiment!,4,male
311,LOKI, Send the rest.,4,male
312,LOKI," ENOUGH! You are, all of you, beneath me! I AM GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND I WILL NOT BE BULLIED BY-",4,male
313,LOKI," If it’s all the same to you, I’ll have that drink now.",4,male
314,NATASHA, I know how you wanted this evening. Believe me this is better.,4,female
315,NATASHA, I thought General Solohob is in charge of the export business.,4,female
316,NATASHA, You really think I’m pretty?,4,female
317,NATASHA, Are you kidding? I’m working.,4,female
318,NATASHA," I’m in the middle of an interrogation, and this moron giving me everything.",4,female
319,NATASHA," Look, you can’t pull me out of this right now.",4,female
320,NATASHA, Let me put you on hold.,4,female
321,NATASHA, But he’s alive?,4,female
322,NATASHA," Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me.",4,female
323,NATASHA, My God.,4,female
324,NATASHA," You know, for a man who’s supposed to be...",4,female
325,NATASHA, Then what is it? Yoga?,4,female
326,NATASHA, Just you and me.,4,female
327,NATASHA, I did.,4,female
328,NATASHA, Natasha Romanoff.,4,female
329,NATASHA," No, no. Of course not. I’m here on behalf of SHIELD.",4,female
330,NATASHA," We never lost you, Doctor. We’ve kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.",4,female
331,NATASHA, Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now we need you to come in.,4,female
332,NATASHA, I’ll persuade you.,4,female
333,NATASHA, You’ve been more than a year without an incident. I don’t think you want to break that streak.,4,female
334,NATASHA," Doctor, we’re facing a potential global catastrophe.",4,female
335,NATASHA, This (takes a seat) is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.,4,female
336,NATASHA," He wants you to find it. It’s been taken. It emits a Gamma signature that’s too weak for us to trace. No one knows Gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that’s where I’d be.",4,female
337,NATASHA," Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.",4,female
338,NATASHA, No one’s going to put you in a-,4,female
339,NATASHA, Stand down. We’re good here.,4,female
340,NATASHA, Hi. They need you on the bridge; they’re starting the face trace.,4,female
341,NATASHA," It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. Thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?",4,female
342,NATASHA, They’re vintage. He’s very proud.,4,female
343,NATASHA," Gentlemen, you might wanna step inside in a minute. It’s gonna get a little had to breathe.",4,female
344,NATASHA, It’s still not gonna find them in time.,4,female
345,NATASHA," You’re gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.",4,female
346,NATASHA, I’m not sure-,4,female
347,NATASHA," Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.",4,female
348,NATASHA, Guy’s all over the place.,4,female
349,NATASHA, Not a word.,4,female
350,NATASHA, Where’s this come from?,4,female
351,NATASHA, Another Asgardian?,4,female
352,NATASHA," Doesn’t matter. If he frees Loki, or kills him, the Tesseract’s lost.",4,female
353,NATASHA," I’d sit this one out, Cap.",4,female
354,NATASHA," These guys come from legend, they’re basically Gods.",4,female
355,NATASHA, Loki has them under some kind of spell- along with one of ours.,4,female
356,NATASHA, He killed eighty people in two days.,4,female
357,NATASHA, But you figured I’d come.,4,female
358,NATASHA, I wanna know what you’ve done to Agent Barton.,4,female
359,NATASHA, And once you’ve won. Once you’re king of the mountain. What happens to his mind?,4,female
360,NATASHA, Love is for children. I owe him a debt.,4,female
361,NATASHA," Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh- well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skill set. I didn’t care who I used it for, or on. I got on SHIELD’s radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call.",4,female
362,NATASHA, Not let you out.,4,female
363,NATASHA," Regime’s fall everyday. I tend not to weep over that, I’m Russian, or I was.",4,female
364,NATASHA, It’s really not that complicated. I got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out.,4,female
365,NATASHA, You’re a monster!,4,female
366,NATASHA," So, Banner? That’s your play.",4,female
367,NATASHA," Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I’m on my way. Send Thor as well. Thank you, for your cooperation!",4,female
368,NATASHA," You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?",4,female
369,NATASHA, Loki’s manipulating you.,4,female
370,NATASHA, You didn’t come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.,4,female
371,NATASHA, Okay!,4,female
372,NATASHA," Doctor? Bruce, you gotta fight it. This is just what Loki wants. We’re gonna be okay. Listen to me.",4,female
373,NATASHA," We’re gonna be okay. Right? I swear on my life I will get you out of this, you will walk away, and never ever --",4,female
374,NATASHA, Bruce.,4,female
375,NATASHA, This is Agent Romanoff. I copy.,4,female
376,NATASHA," Clint, you’re gonna be alright.",4,female
377,NATASHA," You gotta level out, it’s gonna take time.",4,female
378,NATASHA, You know that I do.,4,female
379,NATASHA, Cognitive recalibration. I hit you really hard in the head.,4,female
380,NATASHA," Don’t. Don’t do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for.",4,female
381,NATASHA, Yeah. I don’t suppose you know where?,4,female
382,NATASHA, We gotta stop him.,4,female
383,NATASHA, I don’t know. Whoever is left.,4,female
384,NATASHA, Now you sound like you.,4,female
385,NATASHA," He didn’t, I just-",4,female
386,NATASHA, I’ve been compromised. I got red in my ledger. I’d like to wipe it out.,4,female
387,NATASHA, Go where?,4,female
388,NATASHA, ...three heading north east.,4,female
389,NATASHA, I see ’em.,4,female
390,NATASHA, We got this. It’s good. Go!,4,female
391,NATASHA, Just like Budapest all over again!,4,female
392,NATASHA, How do we do this?,4,female
393,NATASHA, I’ve seen worse.,4,female
394,NATASHA," No, we could- use a little worse.",4,female
395,NATASHA, I don’t see how that’s a party.,4,female
396,NATASHA, Guys?,4,female
397,NATASHA," Captain, none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we don’t close that portal.",4,female
398,NATASHA," Well, maybe it’s not about guns.",4,female
399,NATASHA, I got a ride. I could use a boost though.,4,female
400,NATASHA," Yeah, it’s gonna be fun!",4,female
401,NATASHA, Oh you! Hawkeye!,4,female
402,NATASHA," Uh, a little help!",4,female
403,NATASHA, Doctor.,4,female
404,NATASHA, It’s not your fault. You didn’t know what you were doing.,4,female
405,NATASHA, Loki’s scepter.,4,female
406,NATASHA, I can close it. Can anybody copy? I can shut the portal down!,4,female
407,NATASHA," Come on, Stark.",4,female
408,BANNER, Slow down.,4,male
409,BANNER, Like them?,4,male
410,BANNER, Should have got paid upfront Banner.,4,male
411,BANNER, Avoiding stress isn’t the secret.,4,male
412,BANNER, And you brought me to the end of the city. Smart. I- uh- I assume the whole place is surrounded.,4,male
413,BANNER," And your actress buddy? She a spy too, they start that wrong?",4,male
414,BANNER, Who are you?,4,male
415,BANNER," Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff? ’Cause that’s not going to work out for everyone.",4,male
416,BANNER, SHIELD. How’d they find me?,4,male
417,BANNER, Why?,4,male
418,BANNER, What if I say no?,4,male
419,BANNER, And what if the- Other Guy says no?,4,male
420,BANNER," Well, I don’t every time get what I want.",4,male
421,BANNER, Oh those I actively try to avoid.,4,male
422,BANNER, What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?,4,male
423,BANNER, So Fury isn’t after the monster?,4,male
424,BANNER, And he tells you everything?,4,male
425,BANNER, He needs me in a cage?,4,male
426,BANNER, STOP LYING TO ME! I’m sorry. That was mean. (smiles) I just wanted to see what you’d do. Why don’t we do this the easy way where you don’t use that and the- Other Guy doesn’t make a mess? Okay?,4,male
427,BANNER, Just you and me?,4,male
428,BANNER," Oh, yeah, hi. They told me you’d coming.",4,male
429,BANNER, Is that the only word on me?,4,male
430,BANNER," Must be strange for you, all of this.",4,male
431,BANNER," Really, they want me in a submerged pressurized metal container? Oh no, this is much worse. CARRIER BRIDGE",4,male
432,BANNER," Thanks for asking nicely. So, um, how long am I staying?",4,male
433,BANNER, Well where are you with that?,4,male
434,BANNER, You have to narrow your field. How many Spectrometers do you have access to?,4,male
435,BANNER," Call every lab you know. Tell them to put the Spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for Gamma rays. I’ll rough out a tracking algorithm, basic cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work?",4,male
436,BANNER, Really? Do you have the com-meter sixty-four?,4,male
437,BANNER, Oh you’re very young.,4,male
438,BANNER, He really grows on you doesn’t he?,4,male
439,BANNER," So, he’s building another portal. That’s what he needs Erik Selvig for.",4,male
440,BANNER, He’s an astrophysicist.,4,male
441,BANNER," I don’t think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy’s brain is a bag full of cats, you can small crazy on him.",4,male
442,BANNER," I think it’s about the mechanics. Iridium, what do they need the Iridium for?",4,male
443,BANNER, He’s have to heat the Cube to a hundred and twenty million kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.,4,male
444,BANNER," Well, if he could do that he could achieve heavy-ion fusion at any reactor on the planet.",4,male
445,BANNER, ...Thanks.,4,male
446,BANNER," This way, sir.",4,male
447,BANNER, The Gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig’s reports on the Tesseract. But it’s gonna take weeks to process.,4,male
448,BANNER, All I packed was a toothbrush.,4,male
449,BANNER, Thanks but...last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.,4,male
450,BANNER, Ow!,4,male
451,BANNER, No it’s alright. I wouldn’t have come aboard if I couldn’t handle pointy things.,4,male
452,BANNER," Uh, Aah, I just wanna finish my work here and-",4,male
453,BANNER," A warm light for all mankind,"" Loki’s jab at Fury about the Cube.",4,male
454,BANNER," Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn’t tell Loki about the tower, it was still all over the news.",4,male
455,BANNER," It’s powered by an arc reactor, self-sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for, what, a year?",4,male
456,BANNER," So, why didn’t SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? What are they even doing in the energy business in the first place?",4,male
457,BANNER," Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?",4,male
458,BANNER," Guy’s not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us.",4,male
459,BANNER, I’ll read all about it.,4,male
460,BANNER," Now, you see I don’t get a suit of armor. I’m exposed, like a nerve, it’s a nightmare.",4,male
461,BANNER, But you can control it.,4,male
462,BANNER, It’s different.,4,male
463,BANNER, So you’re saying that the Hulk- the Other Guy- saved my life? That’s nice. That’s nice sentiment. Saved it for- what?,4,male
464,BANNER, You may not enjoy that.,4,male
465,BANNER," We are, the model’s locked and we’re sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we’ll have the location within half a mile.",4,male
466,BANNER, Did you know about this?,4,male
467,BANNER," I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.",4,male
468,BANNER, And you’ve been doing what exactly?,4,male
469,BANNER," Yes, and I’m not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.",4,male
470,BANNER," It’s his MO, isn’t it? I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We’re a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We’re- we’re a time bomb.",4,male
471,BANNER," Yeah, this is a team.",4,male
472,BANNER, WHERE? YOU RENTED MY ROOM!,4,male
473,BANNER," IN CASE YOU NEEDED TO KILL ME. BUT YOU CAN’T, I KNOW, I TRIED! I got low. I didn’t see an end so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out. So I moved on, I focused on helping other people. I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk. You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?",4,male
474,BANNER," Sorry, kids. You don’t get to see my party trick after all. THOR STEVE",4,male
475,BANNER, Oh-my-god.,4,male
476,BANNER, Your life?,4,male
477,BANNER, Did I hurt anyone?,4,male
478,BANNER, Lucky.,4,male
479,BANNER, You saw?,4,male
480,BANNER, Thank you.,4,male
481,BANNER, What?,4,male
482,BANNER, No.,4,male
483,BANNER, Sorry?,4,male
484,BANNER, You know- I’m not even sure.,4,male
485,BANNER, Stark Tower. I- no. Yes.,4,male
486,BANNER," I know where I could do the most good, but it’s where I can do the most harm.",4,male
487,BANNER, I don’t know which way to go.,4,male
488,BANNER," So, this all seems horrible.",4,male
489,BANNER, Sorry.,4,male
490,BANNER," That’s my secret, Cap. I’m always angry.",4,male
491,COUNCILMAN," This is out of line, Director. You’re dealing with forces you can’t control.",4,male
492,COUNCILMAN, You’re saying that this Asgard is declaring war on our planet?,4,male
493,COUNCILMAN," Which is why you should be focusing on Phase Two, it was designed for exactly this purpose.",4,male
494,COUNCILMAN, The Avengers Initiative was shut down.,4,male
495,COUNCILMAN, We’re running the world’s greatest covert security network and you’re gonna leave the fate of the human race to a handful of freaks.,4,male
496,COUNCILMAN," War isn’t won by sentiment, Director.",4,male
497,COUNCILMAN," Director, you’re closer than any of our subs, you scramble that jet-",4,male
498,COUNCILMAN," If we don’t hold them in the air, we lose everything.",4,male
499,COUNCILMAN, That’s not your call.,4,male
500,COUNCILMAN, Was that the point in all this? A statement.,4,male
501,STEVE," Slept for seventy years, Sir. I think I’ve had my fill.",4,male
502,STEVE," When I went under, the world was at war. I wake up- they say we won. They didn’t say what we lost.",4,male
503,STEVE," You here with a mission, Sir?",4,male
504,STEVE, Trying to get me back in the world?,4,male
505,STEVE, HYDRA’s secret weapon.,4,male
506,STEVE, Who took it from you?,4,male
507,STEVE, At this point I doubt anything would surprise me.,4,male
508,STEVE, You should have left it in the ocean.,4,male
509,STEVE," So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum they used on me?",4,male
510,STEVE," Didn’t really go his way, did it?",4,male
511,STEVE," Well, I hope I’m the man for the job.",4,male
512,STEVE, The uniform? Aren’t the stars and stripes a little...old-fashioned?,4,male
513,STEVE, Ma’am.,4,male
514,STEVE, Trading cards?,4,male
515,STEVE, Doctor Banner.,4,male
516,STEVE, Word is you can find the Cube.,4,male
517,STEVE, Only word I care about.,4,male
518,STEVE," Well, this is actually kind of familiar.",4,male
519,STEVE, Is this a submarine?,4,male
520,STEVE," No-no, it’s fine.",4,male
521,STEVE, I don’t like it.,4,male
522,STEVE, I don’t remember it being that easy. This guy packs a wallop.,4,male
523,STEVE, What?,4,male
524,STEVE, Fury didn’t tell me he was calling you in.,4,male
525,STEVE, What’s the matter? Scared of a little lightening?,4,male
526,STEVE," Loki’s gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what’s his play?",4,male
527,STEVE," An army, from outer space?",4,male
528,STEVE, I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He’s not leading an army from here.,4,male
529,STEVE, Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?,4,male
530,STEVE, Is that what just happened?,4,male
531,STEVE, I’d start with that stick of his. It may be magical but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.,4,male
532,STEVE, I do!,4,male
533,STEVE, Hey!,4,male
534,STEVE, Are you nuts?,4,male
535,STEVE, Is everything a joke to you?,4,male
536,STEVE," Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn’t funny. No offense, Doc.",4,male
537,STEVE," And you need to focus on the problem, Mister Stark.",4,male
538,STEVE, You think Fury’s hiding something?,4,male
539,STEVE, Doctor?,4,male
540,STEVE, I heard it.,4,male
541,STEVE, The Stark Tower? That big ugly- -building in New York?,4,male
542,STEVE, I’m sorry did you say-,4,male
543,STEVE, Yet you’re confused about why they didn’t want you around.,4,male
544,STEVE," I think Loki’s trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war and if we don’t stay focused he’ll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them.",4,male
545,STEVE," And you’re all about style, aren’t you?",4,male
546,STEVE, Just find the Cube.,4,male
547,STEVE," Phase Two is SHIELD used the Cube to make weapons. Sorry, computer was moving a little slow for me.",4,male
548,STEVE," I was wrong, Director. The world hasn’t changed a bit.",4,male
549,STEVE, Like you controlled the cube!,4,male
550,STEVE, A higher form?!,4,male
551,STEVE," I’m sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep-",4,male
552,STEVE," I’m sorry, isn’t everything?",4,male
553,STEVE, You know damn well why! Back off!,4,male
554,STEVE," Yeah, big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?",4,male
555,STEVE," I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. I’ve seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You’re not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.",4,male
556,STEVE," Always a way out. You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.",4,male
557,STEVE," Put on the suit, let’s go a few rounds.",4,male
558,STEVE," Doctor Banner, put down the scepter.",4,male
559,STEVE, You’re not going alone!,4,male
560,STEVE," Put on the suit, let’s find out!",4,male
561,STEVE, Put on the suit.,4,male
562,STEVE, Put on the suit.,4,male
563,STEVE," Stark! Stark, I’m here.",4,male
564,STEVE, It seems to run on some form of electricity.,4,male
565,STEVE," ’Kay, the relays are intact.",4,male
566,STEVE, What’s our next move?,4,male
567,STEVE," Well, if that thing gets up to speed, you’ll get shredded!",4,male
568,STEVE, Speak English!,4,male
569,STEVE, i need a minute here!,4,male
570,STEVE, Was he married?,4,male
571,STEVE, I’m sorry. He seemed like a good man.,4,male
572,STEVE, Why? For believing?,4,male
573,STEVE, He was doing his job.,4,male
574,STEVE," Sometimes there isn’t a way out, Tony.",4,male
575,STEVE, Is this the first time you’ve lost a soldier?,4,male
576,STEVE," Neither am I. He’s got the same blood on his hands that Loki does, but right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list-",4,male
577,STEVE, That’s not the point.,4,male
578,STEVE, To tear us apart.,4,male
579,STEVE, Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.,4,male
580,STEVE," What, you gettin’ sleepy?",4,male
581,STEVE, Do it!,4,male

586,STEVE, We won.,4,male
587,IRON MAN, Good to go on this end. The rest is up to you.,4,male
588,IRON MAN, Make a move reindeer games. Good move.,4,male
589,IRON MAN, Captain.,4,male
590,IRON MAN, Now there’s that guy.,4,male
591,IRON MAN, I have a plan. Attack!,4,male
592,IRON MAN, -stay out of the way. Tourist.,4,male
593,IRON MAN," Uh, yeah! No! Bad call, he loves his hammer-",4,male
594,IRON MAN, Good. Let’s see what we got.,4,male
595,IRON MAN, I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position.,4,male
596,IRON MAN," Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won’t re-engage without a jump",4,male
597,IRON MAN," Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.",4,male
598,IRON MAN, Okay.,4,male
599,IRON MAN," Yeah, I got that. I’m beat.",4,male
600,IRON MAN, And there’s one other person you pissed off! His name is Phil.,4,male

602,IRON MAN, Hold On!,4,male
603,IRON MAN," Call it, Captain.",4,male

608,TONY," Grow a spine, JARVIS. I got a date.",4,male
609,TONY," Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which leads me to my next question. How does it feel to be a genius?",4,male
610,TONY, What do you mean? All this came from you.,4,male
611,TONY," Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself- twelve percent of the credit. PEPPER",4,male
612,TONY," Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things and sorry but, the security snafu? That was on you.",4,male
613,TONY, My private elevator.,4,male
614,TONY," Yeah, it was teeming with sweaty workmen. I’m going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later aren’t I?",4,male
615,TONY," I’ll tell you what, next building is gonna say ’Potts’ on the tower.",4,male
616,TONY," Call your mum, can you bunk over?",4,male
617,TONY, Ah-,4,male
618,TONY, You have reached the Life Model Decoy of Tony Stark. Please leave message.,4,male
619,TONY, Then leave it urgently. Security breach. That’s on you!,4,male
620,TONY, Phil?,4,male
621,TONY," Uh, his first name is Agent.",4,male
622,TONY, Which is why he can’t stay.,4,male
623,TONY, I don’t like being handed things.,4,male
624,TONY, Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.,4,male
625,TONY," The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought, and I didn’t even qualify.",4,male
626,TONY," Yeah, apparently I’m volatile, self-obsessed, don’t play well with others.",4,male
627,TONY," Whatever! Ms. Potts, got a sec?",4,male
628,TONY," You know, I thought we were having a moment.",4,male
629,TONY, How would you notice- why is he Phil?,4,male
630,TONY, This is- ah... ...this!,4,male
631,TONY, Tomorrow.,4,male
632,TONY," Well, what if I didn’t?",4,male
633,TONY, Square deal. Fly safe.,4,male
634,TONY," Agent Romanoff, you miss me?",4,male
635,TONY, What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?,4,male
636,TONY," Still, you were pretty spry, for older fellow. What’s your thing? Pilates?",4,male
637,TONY," It’s like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple of things. Y’know, doing time as a Cap-sicle.",4,male
638,TONY," Yeah, there’s a lot of things Fury doesn’t tell you.",4,male
639,TONY, Then don’t take my stuff.,4,male
640,TONY, Uh- Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you wear-th her drapes?,4,male
641,TONY," He gives up the Cube, he’s all yours. Until then-",4,male
642,TONY, Okay!,4,male
643,TONY, How bout that?,4,male
644,TONY," It’s a stabilizing agent. I’m saying, take a weekend; I’ll fly you to Portland. Keep love alive. Means the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD. No hard feelings point break, you got a mean swing.",4,male
645,TONY," Also, means the portal can open as wide and stay open as long as Loki wants. Ah, raise the mizzen mast, ship the topsails. That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn’t notice, but we did. How does Fury even see these?",4,male
646,TONY," Sounds exhausting! The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source- of high energy density. Something to- kick start the Cube.",4,male
647,TONY," Last night. The packet, Selvig’s notes, the extraction theory papers- am I the only one who did the reading?",4,male
648,TONY," Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the Quantum Tunneling effect.",4,male
649,TONY, Finally. Someone who speaks English.,4,male
650,TONY," It’s good to meet you, Doctor Banner. Your work on anti-electronic collisions is unparalleled. And I’m a huge fan of the way you- lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.",4,male
651,TONY," Shall we play, Doctor?",4,male
652,TONY, If we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the Homer cluster we can clock this at around six hundred teraflops.,4,male
653,TONY," You know, you should come by Stark Tower some time. Top ten floors- all R and D. You’d love it, it’s a candy land.",4,male
654,TONY," Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension, no surprises.",4,male
655,TONY, Nothing?,4,male
656,TONY," Jury’s out! You really have got a lid on it, haven’t you? What’s your secret? Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed?",4,male
657,TONY, Funny things are.,4,male
658,TONY," You’re tip-toeing, big man. You need to strut.",4,male
659,TONY," You think I’m not? Why did Fury call us in? Why now, why not before? What isn’t he telling us? I can’t do the equation unless I have all the variables.",4,male
660,TONY," He’s a spy. Captain, he’s the spy. His secrets have secrets. It’s bugging him to, isn’t it?",4,male
661,TONY," It’s just the prototype. I’m kind of the only name in clean energy right now, that’s what he’s getting at.",4,male
662,TONY, I should probably look into that as soon as my decryption program finishes breaking into all of SHIELD’s secure files.,4,male
663,TONY, JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours I’ll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide. Blueberry?,4,male
664,TONY," An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not awesome.",4,male
665,TONY, Following’s not really my style.,4,male
666,TONY," Out of the people in this room, which one is ""A"" wearing a spangly outfit and ""B"" not of use?",4,male
667,TONY, That’s the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn’t have kept him on ice.,4,male
668,TONY," What he’s got is an ACME dynamite kit. It’s gonna blow up in his face, and I’m gonna be there when it does.",4,male
669,TONY," Mhm, or, you’ll be suiting up with the rest of us.",4,male
670,TONY," You know, I’ve got a cluster shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. This stops it- -this little circle of light. It’s part of me now, not just armor. It’s a terrible privilege.",4,male
671,TONY, Because I learned how.,4,male
672,TONY," Hey, I read all about your accident. That much Gamma exposure- should’ve killed you.",4,male
673,TONY, I guess we’ll find out.,4,male
674,TONY, And you just might.,4,male
675,TONY, Uh- kind of been wondering the same thing about you.,4,male
676,TONY," And you’ll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. What is Phase Two?",4,male
677,TONY," I’m sorry, Nick. What were you lying?",4,male
678,TONY, Nuclear deterrent! ’Cause that always calms everything right down.,4,male
679,TONY, Wait-Wait! Hold on! How is this now about me?,4,male
680,TONY, Why shouldn’t they guy let off a little steam?,4,male
681,TONY," Oh, I’m starting to want you to make me.",4,male
682,TONY," Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.",4,male
683,TONY, I think I would just cut the wire.,4,male
684,TONY," A hero, like you? You’re a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.",4,male
685,TONY, You gonna stop me?,4,male
686,TONY, I’m not afraid to hit an old man.,4,male
687,TONY, Yep.,4,male
688,TONY, I’m on it.,4,male
689,TONY, Find engine three. I’ll meet you there.,4,male
690,TONY," I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before can access the rotors, work on dislodging the debris.",4,male
691,TONY, What’s it look like in there?,4,male
692,TONY," Well, you’re not wrong.",4,male
693,TONY, ...I’m gonna have to get in there and push.,4,male
694,TONY, Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage maglev and that should-,4,male
695,TONY, See that red lever? It’ll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.,4,male
696,TONY," Stand by it, wait for my word.",4,male
697,TONY," Yep, noticed.",4,male
698,TONY, Cap hit the lever!,4,male
699,TONY, Lever! Now!,4,male
700,TONY," No. There was a uh- cellist, I think.",4,male
701,TONY, He was an idiot.,4,male
702,TONY, For taking on Loki alone.,4,male
703,TONY, He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have-,4,male
704,TONY, Right. How did that work for him?,4,male
705,TONY, We are not soldiers! I’m not marching to Fury’s fife.,4,male
706,TONY, He made it personal.,4,male
707,TONY, That is the point. That’s Loki’s point. He hit us all right where we live. Why?,4,male
708,TONY," Yeah, divide and conquer is great but- he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That’s what he wants. He wants to beat us, he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience.",4,male
709,TONY," Yeah. That’s just previews, this is- this is opening night. And Loki, he’s a full-tail diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered of-a-bitch.",4,male
710,TONY," Then skip the spinning rims, we’re on the clock.",4,male
711,TONY," Uh- actually, I’m planning to threaten you.",4,male
712,TONY," Yeah, it’s seen a bit of mileage. You’ve got the uh- blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink?",4,male
713,TONY," No, no, no- threatening. No drink? You sure? I’m having one.",4,male
714,TONY," The Avengers. It’s what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. ’Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’ type of thing.",4,male
715,TONY," Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I’ll give you that one. But, let’s do a head count here. Your brother, the Demi-God; A super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you’ve managed to piss off every single one of them.",4,male
716,TONY," Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they’ll come for you.",4,male
717,TONY, We have a Hulk.,4,male
718,TONY," Yeah- you’re missing the point. There’s no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it’s too much for us, but it’s all on you. ’Cause if we can’t protect the earth, you can be damned well sure we’ll avenge it.",4,male
719,TONY," Well, performance issues. You know? JARVIS, anytime now.",4,male
720,TONY, JARVIS. Deploy.,4,male
721,TONY, Right! Army.,4,male
722,TONY," What, did you stop for drive-thru? Swing that park, I’m gonna lay ’em out for you.",4,male
723,TONY, Fine. Let’s keep them occupied.,4,male
724,TONY, ...Where’s Banner? Has he shown up yet?,4,male
725,TONY," Just keep me posted. JARVIS, find me a soft spot.",4,male
726,TONY, It noticed me...,4,male
727,TONY," Thor is right, we gotta deal with these guys.",4,male
728,TONY, Banner?,4,male
729,TONY, Then tell him to suit up. I’m bringing the party to you.,4,male
730,TONY, Just tryin’ to keep them off the streets.,4,male
731,TONY, I will roger that.,4,male
732,TONY, Nice call. What else you got?,4,male
733,TONY, And he didn’t invite me!,4,male
734,TONY," JARVIS, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?",4,male
735,TONY," JARVIS, put everything we got into the thrusters.",4,male
736,TONY," No, wait.",4,male
737,TONY," I got a nuke coming in, it’s gonna blow in less than a minute.",4,male
738,TONY, And I know just where to put it.,4,male
739,TONY, Save the rest for the turn J.,4,male
740,TONY, Might as well.,4,male
741,TONY, What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me.,4,male
742,TONY," Alright, Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let’s just not come in tomorrow. Let’s just take a day. You ever tried shawarma? There’s a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don’t know what it is, but I wanna try it.",4,male
743,TONY, And then shawarma after?,4,male
744,PEPPER," Well, assuming the arc reactor takes over and it actually works.",4,female
745,PEPPER, We’ve got to go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press.,4,female
746,PEPPER, Levels are holding steady- I think.,4,female
747,PEPPER," Well, ah, I really wouldn’t know now would I?",4,female
748,PEPPER," No, all this came from that.",4,female
749,PEPPER, Twelve percent of my baby?,4,female
750,PEPPER, Oh!,4,female
751,PEPPER, You mean our elevator.,4,female
752,PEPPER, Not gonna be that subtle.,4,female
753,PEPPER, On the lease!,4,female
754,PEPPER, Phil! Come in!,4,female
755,PEPPER," Come on in, we’re celebrating.",4,female
756,PEPPER," That’s fine because I love to be handed things. So, let’s trade. Thank you.",4,female
757,PEPPER, Is this about the Avengers? Which I know nothing about.,4,female
758,PEPPER, I didn’t know that either.,4,female
759,PEPPER, That I did know.,4,female
760,PEPPER, Half a moment.,4,female
761,PEPPER, I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious. Phil looks pretty shaken.,4,female
762,PEPPER, What is all this?,4,female
763,PEPPER, I’m going to take the jet to DC tonight.,4,female
764,PEPPER, You have homework. You have a lot of homework.,4,female
765,PEPPER," If you didn’t? You mean when you finished? Well, um, then-",4,female
766,PEPPER," Work hard. So, any chance you’re driving by LaGuardia?",4,female
767,PEPPER, What?...Boo.,4,female
768,JARVIS," Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.",4,male
769,JARVIS," Sir, I’m afraid he’s insisting.",4,male
770,JARVIS," Sir, the telephone. I’m afraid my protocols are being overridden.",4,male
771,JARVIS, Power at four hundred percent capacity.,4,male
772,JARVIS," Sir, I turned off the arc reactor. The device is already self-sustaining",4,male
773,JARVIS, It’s too late! She can’t stop now. She wants to show us something! A new universe.,4,male
774,JARVIS, The barrier is pure energy. It’s unbreachable.,4,male
775,JARVIS," Sir, the Mark Seven is not ready for deployment.",4,male
776,JARVIS," Sir, we have more incoming.",4,male
777,JARVIS," Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell.",4,male
778,JARVIS, I wouldn’t consider him a role model.,4,male
779,JARVIS, I just did.,4,male
780,JARVIS," Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?",4,male
781,JARVIS," Sorry, Miss-",4,male
782,CAPTAIN AMERICA," You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.",4,male
783,CAPTAIN AMERICA, I’m not the one who’s out of time.,4,male
784,CAPTAIN AMERICA, Not today.,4,male
785,CAPTAIN AMERICA, Mister Stark.,4,male
786,CAPTAIN AMERICA, What are you doing?,4,male
787,CAPTAIN AMERICA, That guy’s a friendly.,4,male
788,CAPTAIN AMERICA," Stark, we need a plan of attack.",4,male
789,CAPTAIN AMERICA, I don’t see how I can.,4,male
790,CAPTAIN AMERICA," There’s only one God ma’am, and I’m pretty sure he doesn’t dress like that.",4,male
791,CAPTAIN AMERICA, That’s enough! Now I don’t know what you plan on doing here-,4,male
792,CAPTAIN AMERICA, Then prove it. Put that hammer down.,4,male
793,CAPTAIN AMERICA, Are we done here?,4,male
794,CAPTAIN AMERICA, Time to go.,4,male
795,CAPTAIN AMERICA, I’ll tell you on the way. Can fly one of those jets?,4,male
796,CAPTAIN AMERICA, Got a suit?,4,male
797,CAPTAIN AMERICA, Then suit up.,4,male
798,CAPTAIN AMERICA," Son, just don’t!",4,male
799,CAPTAIN AMERICA, We gotta get back up there.,4,male
800,CAPTAIN AMERICA, Banner?,4,male
801,CAPTAIN AMERICA, Loki. They’re fish in a barrel down there.,4,male
802,CAPTAIN AMERICA, You think you can hold them off?,4,male
803,CAPTAIN AMERICA," You need men in these buildings. There are people inside and they can be running right into the line of fire. You take them to the basement or through the subway, you keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.",4,male
804,CAPTAIN AMERICA, What’s the story upstairs?,4,male
805,CAPTAIN AMERICA, As a team.,4,male
806,CAPTAIN AMERICA," Save it. Loki’s gonna keep this fight focused on us and that’s what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Stark up top, he’s gonna need us to-",4,male
807,CAPTAIN AMERICA," Stark, we got him.",4,male
808,CAPTAIN AMERICA, Just like you said.,4,male
809,CAPTAIN AMERICA," Doctor Banner, now might be a really good time for you to get angry.",4,male
810,CAPTAIN AMERICA," Alright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we’re gonna use containment. Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays. Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or you turn it to ash.",4,male
811,CAPTAIN AMERICA," Thor! You gotta try and bottleneck that portal, slow ’em down. You got the lightning, light the bastards up.",4,male
812,CAPTAIN AMERICA, Our biggest guns couldn’t touch it.,4,male
813,CAPTAIN AMERICA," You wanna get up there, you’re gonna need a ride.",4,male
814,CAPTAIN AMERICA, You sure about this?,4,male
815,CAPTAIN AMERICA, I’m on it.,4,male
816,CAPTAIN AMERICA, Everyone clear out!,4,male
817,THOR, Where is the Tesseract?,4,male
818,THOR, Do I look to be in a gaming mood?,4,male
819,THOR, I thought you dead.,4,male
820,THOR, We all did. Our father-,4,male
821,THOR," We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?",4,male
822,THOR," So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights? No. The Earth is under my protection, Loki.",4,male
823,THOR," Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill.",4,male
824,THOR, Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?,4,male
825,THOR, Not here. You give up the Tesseract; you give up this poisonous dream! You come home.,4,male
826,THOR, You listen well brother-,4,male
827,THOR, Do not touch me again.,4,male
828,THOR, You have no idea what you’re dealing with.,4,male
829,THOR," This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice.",4,male
830,THOR, I’ve come here to put an end to Loki’s schemes!,4,male
831,THOR, You want me to put hammer down?,4,male
832,THOR," He has an army called the Chitauri. They’re not of Asgard nor any world known. He means to lead the against your people. They will win him the Earth, in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.",4,male
833,THOR, Selvig?,4,male
834,THOR, He’s a friend.,4,male
835,THOR," Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason but he is of Asgard, and he is my brother.",4,male
836,THOR, He’s adopted?,4,male
837,THOR, Monkeys? I do not understand-,4,male
838,THOR, Thank you. It’s no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he’s done. Erik is a good man.,4,male
839,THOR," They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we’re more advanced, but we- we come here battling like Bildschneip.",4,male
840,THOR," Bildschneip. You know, huge, scaly, big antlers. You don’t have those?",4,male
841,THOR," Huh! Well they are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path. When I first came to earth, Loki’s rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war.",4,male
842,THOR," I do not know. Loki’s mind is far afield, it’s not just power he craves, it’s vengeance upon me. There’s no pain would prise his need from him.",4,male
843,THOR, What are you asking me to do?,4,male
844,THOR, Loki is a prisoner.,4,male
845,THOR, Me?,4,male
846,THOR, My people want nothing but peace with your planet.,4,male
847,THOR," Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for A HIGHER FORM OF WAR.",4,male
848,THOR, I thought humans were more evolved than this. FURY FURY TONY NATASHA TONY TONY TONY,4,male
849,THOR," You speak of control, yet you court chaos!",4,male
850,THOR," You people are so petty, and tiny.",4,male
851,THOR," We’re not your enemies, Banner! Try to think!",4,male
852,THOR, NO!,4,male
853,THOR," Loki, turn off the Tesseract or I’ll destroy it!",4,male
854,THOR, So be it.,4,male
855,THOR, Look at this! Look around you! You think this madness will end with your rule?,4,male
856,THOR," No. We can, together.",4,male
857,THOR, The power surrounding the cube is impenetrable.,4,male
858,THOR, I have unfinished business with Loki.,4,male
859,THOR, You ready for another bout?,4,male
860,THOR, He’s not slowing down.,4,male
861,THOR, We’re not finished yet.,4,male
862,SECURITY GUARD, You fell out of the sky.,4,male
863,SECURITY GUARD, There’s nobody around here to get hurt. You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though.,4,male
864,SECURITY GUARD, Or just good aim. You were awake when you fell.,4,male
865,SECURITY GUARD," The whole thing, right through the ceiling. Big and green and buck ass nude. Here- didn’t think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular size fella.",4,male
866,SECURITY GUARD, Are you an alien?,4,male
867,SECURITY GUARD," From outer space, an alien?",4,male
868,SECURITY GUARD," Well then, son, you’ve got a condition.",4,male
869,SECURITY GUARD," Are you a big guy that gets all little, or a little guy that, ah- sometimes blows up large?",4,male
870,SECURITY GUARD, You got somewhere to go?,4,male
871,SECURITY GUARD," I’d expect some confusion of the mind, since your body’s kind of all over the place, but it has to be one or the other.",4,male
872,SECURITY GUARD," Well, that’s no different than anybody else. Me? I’m here is Jersey where I can’t do much of either. And since I’m not likely to move on from this placement, you may as well- pilfer my ride.",4,male
873,SECURITY GUARD," Your mind’s already made up, son. The rest of you will follow.",4,male
874,JOHANN SCHMIDT, It has taken me a long time to find this place. You should be commended.,2,male
875,JOHANN SCHMIDT," You are a man of great vision. In that, we are much alike.",2,male
876,JOHANN SCHMIDT," Oh, no, no. I don’t suggest that.",2,male
877,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Then why do you try so hard to hide it?,2,male
878,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Bo. But you can help them.,2,male
879,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Exactly.,2,male
880,JOHANN SCHMIDT, I already have.,2,male
881,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Are you certain the conductors will withstand the energy surge long enough for the transference?,2,male
882,JOHANN SCHMIDT," Then we have lost only time, Doctor. But if it does work...",2,male
883,JOHANN SCHMIDT," I did not come all this way for safety, Doctor.",2,male
884,JOHANN SCHMIDT," Thank you, Doctor. Your designs do not disappoint...",2,male
885,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Doctor Zola. This will change the world.,2,male
886,JOHANN SCHMIDT," And you are now their loyal servant? Berlin, if they care, can discuss it with me personally.",2,male
887,JOHANN SCHMIDT," His serum is the Allies’ only defense against the power we now possess. If we take it away, our victory is assured.",2,male
888,JOHANN SCHMIDT, It’s already been given.,2,male
889,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Reward? You may call it what it really is - an exile. I no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection.,2,male
890,JOHANN SCHMIDT, You came to see the results of our work. Come. Let me show you.,2,male
891,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Hitler speaks of a thousand year Reich. Yet he cannot feed his armies for a month. His troops spill blood by the gallon across every field in Europe. Yet he gets no closer to achieving his goals.,2,male
892,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Science. Though I understand your confusion. Great power has always baffled primitive men.,2,male
893,JOHANN SCHMIDT," I now wield enough destructive force to decimate every hostile capital on earth. Simultaneously. Quite simply, gentlemen...I have harnessed the power of the gods.",2,male
894,JOHANN SCHMIDT, For what?,2,male
895,JOHANN SCHMIDT, So it is.,2,male
896,JOHANN SCHMIDT," My apologies, Doctor, be we both knew Hydra could grow no further in Hitler’s shadow. Hail Hydra.",2,male
897,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Good. Increase output by sixty percent. See to it our other facilities do the same.,2,male
898,JOHANN SCHMIDT," Then use what strength they have left, Doctor. There are always more workers.",2,male
899,JOHANN SCHMIDT," Doctor, prepare to evacuate.",2,male
900,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Our forces are outmatched.,2,male
901,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Captain America. How exciting. I’m a fan of your films.,2,male
902,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Don’t I?,2,male
903,JOHANN SCHMIDT," A failure? Oh, no, Captain.",2,male
904,JOHANN SCHMIDT," Give me what I want, and you will find the Reich most appreciative.",2,male
905,JOHANN SCHMIDT," But what others see as superstition, you and I know to be science. The oldest science.",2,male
906,JOHANN SCHMIDT, The Tesseract was the Jewel of Odin’s treasure room.,2,male
907,JOHANN SCHMIDT, It is not a thing one buries.,2,male
908,JOHANN SCHMIDT," But it is close, yes?",2,male
909,JOHANN SCHMIDT," You have friends out there. Grandchildren, perhaps. I’ve no need for them to die.",2,male
910,JOHANN SCHMIDT," Yggdrasil, tree of the world. Guardian of wisdom...",2,male
911,JOHANN SCHMIDT, And fate.,2,male
912,JOHANN SCHMIDT, And the Fuhrer digs for the trinkets in the desert...,2,male
913,JOHANN SCHMIDT," You’ve never seen it, have you?",2,male
914,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Commence firing.,2,male
915,JOHANN SCHMIDT," In a matter of minutes, we might control the power of the gods. Either way...",2,male
916,JOHANN SCHMIDT, It is a moment of terrible possibility.,2,male
917,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Though they may require reinforcement.,2,male
918,JOHANN SCHMIDT, You disapprove.,2,male
919,JOHANN SCHMIDT, Dr. Zola? What do you think?,2,male
920,JOHANN SCHMIDT," Hydra has perfected a weapon which can destroy my enemies in one swift, brutal stroke. Wherever they are, no matter how many forces they possess. All in a matter of hours.",2,male
921,JOHANN SCHMIDT," So the old man managed it after all. Not quite an improvement, but impressive.",2,male
922,JOHANN SCHMIDT, I was his greatest success.,2,male
923,STEVE, Nope.,2,male
924,STEVE, Mustard gas.,2,male
925,STEVE," Few years back, she was a nurse in the TB ward. Got hit, couldn’t shake it.",2,male
926,STEVE, You can’t do anything?,2,male
927,STEVE," Can you keep it down, please?",2,male
928,STEVE, YOU WANT TO SHUT UP?,2,male
929,STEVE, I can do this all day.,2,male
930,STEVE, I hade him on the ropes.,2,male
931,STEVE, Looks like you got your orders.,2,male
932,STEVE," So, what’s the first stop. Church?",2,male
933,STEVE, Where are we going?,2,male
934,STEVE, I’d settle for just one.,2,male
935,STEVE, What’d you tell her about me?,2,male
936,STEVE, You go ahead.,2,male
937,STEVE, It’s a fair. I’m gonna try my luck.,2,male
938,STEVE, You don’t think I can do it.,2,male
939,STEVE, You want me to sit in a factory? Collect scrap metal in my little red wagon while the men are laying down their lives? I can do as well as them and I got no right to do any less.,2,male
940,STEVE," Remember, when you attack, you run toward the enemy. ALT. I can’t. You’re taking all the stupid with you.",2,male
941,STEVE, You’re a jerk.,2,male
942,STEVE, Am I in trouble?,2,male
943,STEVE, I’m in trouble.,2,male
944,STEVE, Excuse me?,2,male
945,STEVE, Steve Rogers. Where are you from ?,2,male
946,STEVE, That might not be the right file-,2,male
947,STEVE, Is this a test?,2,male
948,STEVE," I don’t like bullies, Doctor. I don’t care where they’re from.",2,male
949,STEVE," Maybe. What do you do, exactly?",2,male
950,STEVE, That’s all I’m asking for.,2,male
951,STEVE, New York City. ALT. Brooklyn,2,male
952,STEVE, Everybody DOWN!,2,male
953,STEVE," Got the jitters, I guess.",2,male
954,STEVE, Can I ask you a question?,2,male
955,STEVE, Why me?,2,male
956,STEVE, Did it make him strong?,2,male
957,STEVE, Thanks. I think.,2,male
958,STEVE, To the little guys.,2,male
959,STEVE, We’ll drink it after.,2,male
960,STEVE, I know this neighborhood. I got beat up in that alley...and that vacant lot...and behind that diner.,2,male
961,STEVE," You start running, they’ll never let you stop. You stand up, you push back...they can only tell you “no” for so long, right?",2,male
962,STEVE, Who’d shut a door on you? I figure guys would be climbing over each other to hold them open.,2,male
963,STEVE, I guess I don’t know why a beautiful...agent...why would she want to join the army anyhow? She could do whatever she wanted.,2,male
964,STEVE," You got me all wrong, Agent Carter. I don’t know anything about women. This is probably the longest conversation I’ve ever had with one.",2,male
965,STEVE," Standing on my mom’s feet when I was seven. I don’t know. Asking a girl to dance seemed so terrifying, and then in the last few years it didn’t seem so important. I figure I might as well wait.",2,male
966,STEVE, The right partner.,2,male
967,STEVE, Why did we stop here?,2,male
968,STEVE, You save me any of that schnapps?,2,male
969,STEVE, I was you at the Expo. Did you ever get that Cadillac in the air?,2,male
970,STEVE, Then what happened?,2,male
971,STEVE, That wasn’t so bad.,2,male
972,STEVE, Doctor? Did it...?,2,male
973,STEVE, Taller...,2,male
974,STEVE, NO!,2,male
975,STEVE, Great. I can’t.,2,male
976,STEVE, Who the hell are you?,2,male
977,STEVE, You think you’ve got enough?,2,male
978,STEVE, Erskine deserved more than that.,2,male
979,STEVE," Sir? If you’re going after Schmidt, I want in.",2,male
980,STEVE," As what, a lab rat? The serum worked!",2,male
981,STEVE, It’s all I want.,2,male
982,STEVE, I don’t know if I can do this.,2,male
983,STEVE, Not how I pictured getting there.,2,male
984,STEVE, Who’s fighting to keep you safe at home?,2,male
985,STEVE," It’s the American soldier, that’s who.",2,male
986,STEVE, We all know this isn’t about having a swell afternoon. This is about winning the war.,2,male
987,STEVE," Sorry, kid. Tell your brother he’s wrong...",2,male
988,STEVE, Okay...I’m going to need a volunteer.,2,male
989,STEVE," I think they only know the one song, but...I’ll...see what I can do...",2,male
990,STEVE," Hey, guys, we’re all on the same side-",2,male
991,STEVE," Yeah, I...had to improvise a bit. The crowds I’m used to are usually more...twelve.",2,male
992,STEVE," People buy bonds, bonds buy bullets, bullets kill Nazis. Sales rise ten percent in every state I visit.",2,male
993,STEVE," Hey, Phillips was going to stick me in a lab. At least Brandt got me here.",2,male
994,STEVE," It’s just, you get enough people telling you you’re a hero, after years of them telling you you’re nothing... All I dreamed about was coming overseas, being on the front lines, serving my country. I finally get everything I wanted...and I’m wearing tights.",2,male
995,STEVE, Hydra?,2,male
996,STEVE," Back home, that’s a yes.",2,male
997,STEVE, The 107th?,2,male
998,STEVE, Come on.,2,male
999,STEVE, Azzano. I want to see the casualty list.,2,male
1000,STEVE, I don’t need the whole list. Just one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.,2,male
1001,STEVE," Just tell me if he’s alive, sir.  B- A-R-",2,male
1002,STEVE, What about the others? You’re planning a rescue mission?,2,male
1003,STEVE, But if you know where they are-,2,male
1004,STEVE, I think I understand pretty well.,2,male
1005,STEVE," Yes, sir. I do.",2,male
1006,STEVE," Just get me as close as you can. You know, you’re both going to be in a lot of trouble when you land.",2,male
1007,STEVE," Yeah, but where I’m landing, if anybody yells at me, I get to shoot them.",2,male
1008,STEVE, It’s got to be good for something.,2,male
1009,STEVE, Why is he saying “fondue” like that? What’s fondue?,2,male
1010,STEVE," Do you, are you two...fondue?",2,male
1011,STEVE, You sure it works?,2,male
1012,STEVE," ONCE I’M CLEAR, TURN THIS THING AROUND AND GET OUT OF HERE!",2,male
1013,STEVE, THE HELL I CAN’T! I’M A CAPTAIN!,2,male
1014,STEVE, Hi.,2,male
1015,STEVE, I’m...Captain America.,2,male
1016,STEVE, Are there any others?,2,male
1017,STEVE," The tree line’s northwest, about 80 yards from the gate. From there, just follow the creek bed. I’ll meet you in the clearing with anybody I find inside.",2,male
1018,STEVE, Sure. I’ve knocked out Adolph Hitler over 200 times.,2,male
1019,STEVE, Bucky?,2,male
1020,STEVE," It’s me, Buck.",2,male
1021,STEVE, I thought you were dead.,2,male
1022,STEVE, I joined the Army.,2,male
1023,STEVE, Little bit.,2,male
1024,STEVE, So far.,2,male
1025,STEVE, You’ve go no idea.,2,male
1026,STEVE, Erskine said your experiment was a failure.,2,male
1027,STEVE, Then how come you’re running?,2,male
1028,STEVE, Hurry.,2,male
1029,STEVE, JUST GET OUT!,2,male
1030,STEVE," Aw, hell.",2,male
1031,STEVE," Colonel, some of these men need medical attention.",2,male
1032,STEVE," Sir, I-",2,male
1033,STEVE," Yes, sir.",2,male
1034,STEVE," Sorry, couldn’t call my ride.",2,male
1035,STEVE, I’m off the publicity circuit.,2,male
1036,STEVE, If?,2,male
1037,STEVE, The ones we know about. But Sgt. Barnes said Hydra shipped all the bombs to another facility. And that...wasn’t on the map.,2,male
1038,STEVE, I’m going to need a team.,2,male
1039,STEVE," If you don’t mind, sir...so Have I.",2,male
1040,STEVE, Pretty much.,2,male
1041,STEVE, What’s that?,2,male
1042,STEVE, Another round?,2,male
1043,STEVE, What about you? You gonna follow Captain America into the jaws of death?,2,male
1044,STEVE, Don’t get your hopes up. It’s not exactly regulation.,2,male
1045,STEVE, Agent Carter.,2,male
1046,STEVE, That sounds fine.,2,male
1047,STEVE, Yes ma’am. I’ll be there.,2,male
1048,STEVE," Oh, I was just doing what needed to be done.",2,male
1049,STEVE, Really. It wasn’t a big thing.,2,male
1050,STEVE, I...don’t think they were all married.,2,male
1051,STEVE," Well, maybe. Depending on whose definition-",2,male
1052,STEVE, Peggy. That wasn’t what you thought it was.,2,male
1053,STEVE, Well what about you and Stark? How do I know what you two haven’t been...fonduing the whole time?,2,male
1054,STEVE," Really, I didn’t think-",2,male
1055,STEVE, It’s handier than you might think.,2,male
1056,STEVE, What about this one?,2,male
1057,STEVE, What’s it made of?,2,male
1058,STEVE, How come it’s not standard issue?,2,male
1059,STEVE, What do you think?,2,male
1060,STEVE, About my uniform...,2,male
1061,STEVE, And I threw up?,2,male
1062,STEVE, Now why would I do a thing like that?,2,male
1063,STEVE, Punk.,2,male
1064,STEVE," Okay, this is a very short, very fast train. We’ve got a ten-second window, tops. Mistime it and you’re a bug on the windshield.",2,male
1065,STEVE, They were.,2,male
1066,STEVE," Bucky, no!",2,male
1067,STEVE, BUCKY!,2,male
1068,STEVE," Doctor Erskine told me the serum, wouldn’t just work on my muscles and my reflexes - he said it would work in my cells, create a protective system of healing, of regenerating. Which means...",2,male
1069,STEVE, Probably didn’t want anybody stealing his schnapps.,2,male
1070,STEVE, You read the report?,2,male
1071,STEVE, Then you know that’s not true.,2,male
1072,STEVE," I got in over my head. Bucky waded in and pulled me out, just like he always did. And the one time he needed me to return the favor, I couldn’t.",2,male
1073,STEVE, All I had to do was hold him.,2,male
1074,STEVE," As soon as I finish this, I’m going after Johann Schmidt. I’m going to burn out every hole there is for him to hide in. And I’m not going to stop until he and all of Hydra are captured or dead.",2,male
1075,STEVE, Every able-bodied man we have is either here or in the Pacific. Our borders are wide open.,2,male
1076,STEVE, Where is he now?,2,male
1077,STEVE, He told me you were insane. That seemed like enough.,2,male
1078,STEVE, Nothing...,2,male
1079,STEVE, So am I.,2,male
1080,STEVE, Thanks.,2,male
1081,STEVE, You’re late.,2,male
1082,STEVE, Right.,2,male
1083,STEVE, Closer!,2,male
1084,STEVE, Hold it steady this time.,2,male
1085,STEVE, Nope.,2,male
1086,STEVE, Keep the future. I’m looking for a little here and now.,2,male
1087,STEVE, I want what every soldier on every battlefield wants...,2,male
1088,STEVE, There isn’t going to be a landing. Schmidt’s locked the navigation system.,2,male
1089,STEVE, I’m sitting on a hundred tons of explosives. Hotwiring this thing’s not an option.,2,male
1090,STEVE, I can’t. But I think I can crash it.,2,male
1091,STEVE," I already did. Right now, I’m in the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer, a lot of people are going to get hurt.",2,male
1092,STEVE, I don’t think there’s going to be much left to find.,2,male
1093,STEVE, I’m going to need a raincheck on that dance.,2,male
1094,STEVE, Okay. You got it.,2,male
1095,STEVE, I still don’t know how to dance.,2,male
1096,STEVE," Maybe the band could play something slow, I’d hate to step on your-",2,male
1097,STEVE, I don’t...remember going to sleep.,2,male
1098,STEVE, How long have I been out?,2,male
1099,STEVE, Who are you? How do you know my name?,2,male
1100,STEVE, Who are you?,2,male
1101,STEVE, Where am I?,2,male
1102,STEVE, Break what?,2,male
1103,STEVE, Seventy... The World of the Future.,2,male
1104,STEVE, What about the war? Did we win?,2,male
1105,STEVE, How am I...not dead?,2,male
1106,STEVE, What? Oh. Bob Chipman was traded for Eddie Stanky during the ‘44 season. He’s with the Cubs now. Or...was.,2,male
1107,STEVE, Yeah. It’s just...,2,male
1108,STEVE, 1918. He was in the 107th Infantry. I was hoping to get assigned to them if-,2,male
1109,STEVE," They weren’t weak, Doc; they were fighters. If you just give me a-",2,male
1110,STEVE, Don’t win the war till I get there.,2,male
1111,STEVE, Uh...is this a test?,2,male
1112,STEVE," I wish I were kidding. Think about it; I don’t have any money, so I can’t take them to dinner. I’m... kinda short. That doesn’t help. Ever. And I don’t dance, so that’s off the table.",2,male
1113,STEVE, Don’t...,2,male
1114,STEVE, I can do this.,2,male
1115,STEVE, Doc!,2,male
1116,STEVE, But we can’t do it without bullets and bandages. Without tanks and tents. That’s where you come in.,2,male
1117,STEVE, Each bond you buy protects someone you love. So our boys will be armed and ready.,2,male
1118,STEVE, And so the Germans will think twice before trying to get the drop on us-,2,male
1119,STEVE, It was eight German tanks.,2,male
1120,STEVE, Looks like they’ve been through hell.,2,male
1121,STEVE, I’d like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.,2,male
1122,STEVE," And the last was outside of Strasbourg, say thirty, forty miles west of the Maginot line. I only go a quick look.",2,male
1123,STEVE, Maybe she’s got a friend.,2,male
1124,STEVE, I had some ideas.,2,male
1125,STEVE, I can’t get drunk. Did you know that?,2,male
1126,STEVE, I’m just a kid from Brooklyn.,2,male
1127,STEVE, I can do this all day.,2,male
1128,STEVE, I want to go home. ALT. I want this war to end.,2,male
1129,STEVE, And there’s more than enough power to reach the East Coast.,2,male
1130,STEVE, I’ve got to put her in the water.,2,male
1131,STEVE, Peggy?,2,male
1132,STEVE, I have a date.,2,male
1133,BUCKY," How many times is this? And you’re from Paramus now? It’s still illegal to lie on an enlistment form, and seriously, Jersey?",2,male
1134,BUCKY, 107th ships to England first thing tomorrow. This is my last night.,2,male
1135,BUCKY, Yeah...maybe second stop.,2,male
1136,BUCKY, The future.,2,male
1137,BUCKY, I don’t see what the problem is. You’re about to be the last eligible man in New York. You know there’re three and a half million women here?,2,male
1138,BUCKY, Good thing I’ve taken care of that.,2,male
1139,BUCKY, Only the good stuff.,2,male
1140,BUCKY, Ho-ly cow.,2,male
1141,BUCKY," Hey, Steve. What do you say we treat these ladies-",2,male
1142,BUCKY," You’re kind of missing the point of a “double date.” Come on, we’re gonna get a chocolate soda.",2,male
1143,BUCKY, You’re really gonna do this now?,2,male
1144,BUCKY," As who? “Steve from Ohio”? They’ll catch you. Or worse, they’ll actually take you.",2,male
1145,BUCKY," This isn’t some back alley, Steve. It’s a war. Why are you so keen to fight? There’re lots of other important jobs-",2,male
1146,BUCKY, Right. ‘Cause you’ve got nothing to prove.,2,male
1147,BUCKY, Yeah. We are.,2,male
1148,BUCKY, You’re a punk.,2,male
1149,BUCKY, Who...who is that?,2,male
1150,BUCKY, Steve?,2,male
1151,BUCKY, I thought you were smaller.,2,male
1152,BUCKY, Did it hurt?,2,male
1153,BUCKY, Is it permanent?,2,male
1154,BUCKY, You are going to get so many girls.,2,male
1155,BUCKY," You don’t have one of those, do you?",2,male
1156,BUCKY, There's got to be a rope or something-,2,male
1157,BUCKY, Not without you.,2,male
1158,BUCKY, That was the easiest battle of the war.,2,male
1159,BUCKY, Hell no. That little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb to run away from a fight? I’m following him.,2,male
1160,BUCKY, I dunno. You saw those guys in Italy when you came back. I don’t think they were cheering just for you.,2,male
1161,BUCKY, Ma’am.,2,male
1162,BUCKY, You don’t like music?,2,male
1163,BUCKY, Then what are we waiting for?,2,male
1164,BUCKY, Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?,2,male
1165,BUCKY," This isn’t payback, is it?",2,male
1166,BUCKY, Jerk.,2,male
1167,BUCKY, I thought they were supposed to be hauling something.,2,male
1168,HOWARD STARK," Ladies, you know how hard it can be putting on makeup in a car that’s bouncing like a kangaroo on a trampoline.",2,male
1169,HOWARD STARK," With Stark Gravitic Reversion Technology (patent pending), you’ll be able to do just tha-",2,male
1170,HOWARD STARK," Coils are at peak, levels are 100%. We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn, but we’re ready. As we’ll ever be.",2,male
1171,HOWARD STARK, Had her flying three full minutes.,2,male
1172,HOWARD STARK, We landed. Technically.,2,male
1173,HOWARD STARK," You did it, Doctor. You really did it.",2,male
1174,HOWARD STARK," Well, speaking modestly, I’d say I’m the best mechanical engineer in the country...",2,male
1175,HOWARD STARK, We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.,2,male
1176,HOWARD STARK," Agent Carter, if we’re not in too much of a hurry, I thought we’d stop in Lucerne for a late night fondue.",2,male
1177,HOWARD STARK, It’s been tested more than you have.,2,male
1178,HOWARD STARK," Hey, aren’t you supposed to be picking up a medal right about now?",2,male
1179,HOWARD STARK," If you believe Rogers, it’s apparently the most powerful explosive known to man.",2,male
1180,HOWARD STARK," Well, either you’re wrong or Schmidt’s damn near rewritten the laws of physics.",2,male
1181,HOWARD STARK," Emission signature is unusual. Alpha, beta and gamma ray neutral. Though I doubt Rogers picked up on that.",2,male
1182,HOWARD STARK," Fondue’s just cheese and bread, my friend.",2,male
1183,HOWARD STARK," Nor should you, pal. The minute you think you know what’s in a woman’s head is the minute your goose is well and truly cooked.",2,male
1184,HOWARD STARK," So’s the hotel chambermaid, but I wouldn’t taker her into battle.",2,male
1185,HOWARD STARK," Oh, that’s just a prototype. Now this one-",2,male
1186,HOWARD STARK, Vibranium. Stronger than steel and a third of the weight.,2,male
1187,HOWARD STARK, It’s the rarest metal on earth. You’re holding all we’ve got.,2,male
1188,HOWARD STARK," Whatever you want, sport.",2,male
1189,HOWARD STARK," Schmidt’s working with powers beyond our capabilities. He gets across the Atlantic, he’ll wipe out the entire eastern seaboard in an hour.",2,male
1190,HOWARD STARK, Move us to the next grid point.,2,male
1191,HOWARD STARK, Just keep looking.,2,male
1192,HOWARD STARK," What if I told you that in just a few short years, your automobile wouldn’t touch the ground at all?",2,male
1193,HOWARD STARK," I did say a few years, didn’t I?",2,male
1194,HOWARD STARK, And I’ve got no idea what any of this is or how it works. We’re nowhere near capable of this technology.,2,male
1195,HOWARD STARK, And I’m rather fond of the laws of physics...,2,male
1196,HOWARD STARK, Hmm. Looks harmless enough.,2,male
1197,HOWARD STARK, Hard to see what all the fuss is ab-,2,male
1198,HOWARD STARK, Write that down.,2,male
1199,HOWARD STARK, And it looks to me like she thinks you’ve got a lot more going for you than that.,2,male
1200,HOWARD STARK, And it sounds like she thinks you’ve got more going for you than that.,2,male
1201,HOWARD STARK," Me, I concentrate on work. Which at the moment is making sure you and your men don’t get killed.",2,male
1202,HOWARD STARK," Carbon polymer. Ought to hold its own against your average German bayonet. Of course, Hydra’s not likely to come at you with a pocket knife...",2,male
1203,HOWARD STARK, I hear you’re sort of attached.,2,male
1204,HOWARD STARK, I took the liberty of coming up with a few options. This one’s fun. It’s fitted with transistorized relays.,2,male
1205,HOWARD STARK, It’s completely vibration absorbent. Should make a bullet feel like a cotton ball.,2,male
1206,DR. ERSKINE," So, you want to go overseas, kill some Nazis?",2,male
1207,DR. ERSKINE, I’m Doctor Abraham Erskine. I represent the Strategic Scientific Reserve.,2,male
1208,DR. ERSKINE," Queens. 73rd and Utopia Parkway. And before that, German. This troubles you?",2,male
1209,DR. ERSKINE, It is not the exams I am interested in. It is the five tries. You didn’t answer my question. You want to kill Nazis?,2,male
1210,DR. ERSKINE, Yes.,2,male
1211,DR. ERSKINE," There are already plenty of big strapping men in this war. What they need now is maybe the “little guys,” yea?",2,male
1212,DR. ERSKINE, ALT. Let’s say I believe there is great potential in every human. It’s just a matter of bringing it to the surface.,2,male
1213,DR. ERSKINE," So, really, where is the little guy from?",2,male
1214,DR. ERSKINE, I am more than just thinking about it. He is the clear choice.,2,male
1215,DR. ERSKINE, I am searching for qualities beyond the physical.,2,male
1216,DR. ERSKINE, I’m well aware of your efforts-,2,male
1217,DR. ERSKINE, He’s a bully.,2,male
1218,DR. ERSKINE, Can’t sleep?,2,male
1219,DR. ERSKINE," Me, too.",2,male
1220,DR. ERSKINE, Just one?,2,male
1221,DR. ERSKINE, I suppose that is the only question that matters.,2,male
1222,DR. ERSKINE," German operas about war and heroes. Blood and race. Gods afoot upon the earth. Me, I like a little Benny Goodman. ALT. Me, I like jazz.",2,male
1223,DR. ERSKINE," Yes, but there were other...effects.",2,male
1224,DR. ERSKINE," This is why you were chosen. A strong man, he might lose respect for the power if he has had it all his life. But a weak man knows the value of strength...and compassion.",2,male
1225,DR. ERSKINE," Whatever happens tomorrow, promise me you’ll stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier...",2,male
1226,DR. ERSKINE," What am I doing, you have a procedure tomorrow. No fluids.",2,male
1227,DR. ERSKINE, I don’t have procedure tomorrow. Is very good. I save you a little.,2,male
1228,DR. ERSKINE, Comfortable?,2,male
1229,DR. ERSKINE, Not as much as I should have.,2,male
1230,DR. ERSKINE," Agent Carter, wouldn’t you be more comfortable in the booth?",2,male
1231,DR. ERSKINE, The serum will cause immediate cellular change.,2,male
1232,DR. ERSKINE, That was a tetanus shot.,2,male
1233,DR. ERSKINE, We shall proceed.,2,male
1234,DR. ERSKINE," MR. STARK, KILL THE REACTORS",2,male
1235,DR. ERSKINE, Mr. Stark!,2,male
1236,DR. ERSKINE, Steven?,2,male
1237,DR. ERSKINE, I think...yes...,2,male
1238,DR. ERSKINE," Please, do not smoke in here-",2,male
1239,DR. ERSKINE," And where are you from, Mr. Rogers? Is it New Haven, or Paramus, or... Five exams. In five different cities...",2,male
1240,DR. ERSKINE," I can offer you a chance, only a chance.",2,male
1241,DR. ERSKINE," Made in Augsburg. My city. So many forget that the first country the Nazis invaded was their own. I don’t excuse what my people have become. After the first war, my people struggled...they felt weak, small. Then Hitler comes with big show, the marching. He finds me. Hears of my work. You, he says, will make us strong.",2,male
1242,DR. ERSKINE," Hitler uses these fantasies to inspire his followers. But Schmidt ...he does not believe in fantasy. For him, it is real.",2,male
1243,DR. ERSKINE, But a good man.,2,male
1244,DR. ERSKINE," How are your levels, Mr. Stark?",2,male
1245,DR. ERSKINE," Ladies and gentlemen, this morning we do not take another step toward annihilation. Today, we take the first step on the path to peace.",2,male
1246,DR. ERSKINE," Beginning serum infusion in five, four, three, two...one.",2,male
1247,DR. ERSKINE," Now, Mr. Stark.",2,male
1248,DR. ERSKINE," Steven, can you hear me?",2,male
1249,DR. ERSKINE, Steven? STEVEN?,2,male
1250,DR. ERSKINE, No...,2,male
1251,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, My machine requires the most delicate calibration.,2,male
1252,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, With this...artifact...I am certain of nothing.,2,male
1253,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, We are stable at seventy percent. Well within safety parameters.,2,male
1254,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, At those levels the power may be uncontroll-,2,male
1255,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, The exchange is stable. Amazing. The energy we’ve just collected could power a battleship. Ten battleships. This will change the war.,2,male
1256,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, Sir?,2,male
1257,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, I understand you’ve found him.,2,male
1258,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, Berlin doesn’t feel this is a proper use of their resources.,2,male
1259,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, I just don’t see why you need concern yourself. I can’t imagine he’ll succeed- Again.,2,male
1260,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, Shall I give the order?,2,male
1261,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, A masterpiece.,2,male
1262,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, Hail Hydra.,2,male
1263,DR. ARNIM ZOLA," As you see, production is proceeding faultlessly.",2,male
1264,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, But our...workers. I am not sure they have the strength.,2,male
1265,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, I’m sure our forces can handle-,2,male
1266,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, Sir? We’re going to the roof?,2,male
1267,DR. ARNIM ZOLA," Sir, this is hardly my area of expertise. I merely develop the weapons, I cannot fire them. And the Allies did not take this installation easily. Your troops fought to the death.",2,male
1268,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, No. Finish the other one.,2,male
1269,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, Again! Fire again!,2,male
1270,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, What is this?,2,male
1271,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, What’s in it?,2,male
1272,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, I don’t eat meat.,2,male
1273,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, It disagrees with me.,2,male
1274,DR. ARNIM ZOLA," Are you trying to intimidate me, Colonel?",2,male
1275,DR. ARNIM ZOLA," “Given the valuable information he has provided, and in exchange for his full cooperation, Doctor Zola is being remanded to Switzerland -”",2,male
1276,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, Schmidt will know this is a lie.,2,male
1277,DR. ARNIM ZOLA," By the time you act, it will be too late. Schmidt believes he walks in the footsteps of gods. Only the world itself will satisfy him.",2,male
1278,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, The sanity of the plan is of little consequence.,2,male
1279,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, Because he can do it.,2,male
1280,DR. ARNIM ZOLA, Everywhere.,2,male
1281,PEGGY CARTER," What’s your name, soldier?",2,female
1282,PEGGY CARTER," Step forward, Hodge.",2,female
1283,PEGGY CARTER," Are you familiar with the art of Jiu Jitsu, wherein your opponent’s size and momentum are used against him?",2,female
1284,PEGGY CARTER, Neither am I.,2,female
1285,PEGGY CARTER, Colonel Phillips.,2,female
1286,PEGGY CARTER, Did you have something against running away?,2,female
1287,PEGGY CARTER, I know a bit what that’s like. To have every door shut in your face.,2,female
1288,PEGGY CARTER, Depends which door you’re trying to go through.,2,female
1289,PEGGY CARTER," You don’t know an awful lot about women, do you?",2,female
1290,PEGGY CARTER, You must have at least danced.,2,female
1291,PEGGY CARTER, For what?,2,female
1292,PEGGY CARTER, This is it.,2,female
1293,PEGGY CARTER, I love a bargain. ALT. I’m redecorating.,2,female
1294,PEGGY CARTER," Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.",2,female
1295,PEGGY CARTER, Best to be prepared for a shift in the wind.,2,female
1296,PEGGY CARTER, A dozen eggs and your finest selection of cheese.,2,female
1297,PEGGY CARTER, I buy my milk at the store.,2,female
1298,PEGGY CARTER, Shut it down!,2,female
1299,PEGGY CARTER, How do you feel?,2,female
1300,PEGGY CARTER, I HAD HIM!,2,female
1301,PEGGY CARTER," All of Dr. Erskine’s research and equipment is gone. Any hope of reproducing the program is locked in your genetic code. But it would take years. At the moment, you’re the only super soldier there is.",2,female
1302,PEGGY CARTER," If it could work only once, he’d be proud it was you.",2,female
1303,PEGGY CARTER," Hydra is the Nazi deep science division. It’s led by Dr. Erskine’s first test subject, Johann Schmidt.",2,female
1304,PEGGY CARTER, Colonel?,2,female
1305,PEGGY CARTER, I understand you’re “America’s New Hope.”,2,female
1306,PEGGY CARTER, Is that Senator Brandt I hear?,2,female
1307,PEGGY CARTER, And are those your only option? Lab rat or dancing monkey? You know you’re meant for more than this.,2,female
1308,PEGGY CARTER, These men more than most.,2,female
1309,PEGGY CARTER, Not officially.,2,female
1310,PEGGY CARTER," Schmidt was moving a force through Azzano. 200 hundred men went up against them, less than fifty came back. Your audience contained all that’s left of the 107th. The rest were killed or captured.",2,female
1311,PEGGY CARTER," Yes, what?",2,female
1312,PEGGY CARTER," Sir, Rogers is only on loan to the USO. Officially, he is still SSR.",2,female
1313,PEGGY CARTER, And you’re not?,2,female
1314,PEGGY CARTER, They’re undoubtedly going to shoot back.,2,female
1315,PEGGY CARTER," Stark’s the best civilian pilot I’ve ever seen, and mad enough to brave this airspace. We’re lucky to have him.",2,female
1316,PEGGY CARTER, Take this transponder. Activate it when you’re ready and the signal will lead us right to you.,2,female
1317,PEGGY CARTER," Rogers, get back here. We’re taking you all the way in!",2,female
1318,PEGGY CARTER, YOU CAN’T GIVE ME ORDERS!,2,female
1319,PEGGY CARTER, The last surveillance flight is back.,2,female
1320,PEGGY CARTER, You’ll have my resignation in the morning.,2,female
1321,PEGGY CARTER," With respect, sir, I don’t regret my actions. And I doubt Captain Rogers did, either.",2,female
1322,PEGGY CARTER, It wasn’t that. I had faith.,2,female
1323,PEGGY CARTER, You’re late.,2,female
1324,PEGGY CARTER, Nobody’s perfect.,2,female
1325,PEGGY CARTER, What about us?,2,female
1326,PEGGY CARTER, Howard’s got some equipment for you to try. Tomorrow morning?,2,female
1327,PEGGY CARTER, I see your crack squad is prepping for duty.,2,female
1328,PEGGY CARTER," I do, actually. I may even, when this is all over, go dancing.",2,female
1329,PEGGY CARTER, The right partner.,2,female
1330,PEGGY CARTER, Captain. We’re ready for you...if you’re not otherwise occupied.,2,female
1331,PEGGY CARTER, Looks like finding a partner wasn’t that hard after all.,2,female
1332,PEGGY CARTER," I don’t think anything, Captain. Not one thing.",2,female
1333,PEGGY CARTER, You still don’t understand a bloody thing about women.,2,female
1334,PEGGY CARTER," Are you about finished, Mr. Stark? I’m sure the Captain has some unfinished business.",2,female
1335,PEGGY CARTER, I think it works.,2,female
1336,PEGGY CARTER, Your metabolism burns three times faster than average. He thought it could be one of the side effects.,2,female
1337,PEGGY CARTER, It wasn’t your fault.,2,female
1338,PEGGY CARTER, Yes.,2,female
1339,PEGGY CARTER, You did everything you could-,2,female
1340,PEGGY CARTER, I doubt it’s that simple.,2,female
1341,PEGGY CARTER, Did you believe in your friend? Respect him?,2,female
1342,PEGGY CARTER, Let’s go then.,2,female
1343,PEGGY CARTER," So’s Hitler, but he’s gotten pretty far with less than Schmidt has.",2,female
1344,PEGGY CARTER, Tell me you’re not complaining. Weren’t you about to...?,2,female
1345,PEGGY CARTER, Wait!,2,female
1346,PEGGY CARTER," Steve, is that you? Are you okay?",2,female
1347,PEGGY CARTER, Where’s Schmidt?,2,female
1348,PEGGY CARTER, What about the plane?,2,female
1349,PEGGY CARTER, Give me your coordinates. I’ll find a landing site-,2,female
1350,PEGGY CARTER, I’ll get Howard on the line. He’ll know what to do.,2,female
1351,PEGGY CARTER, But you said you couldn’t steer it.,2,female
1352,PEGGY CARTER," Steve, don’t do this. We’ve got time. We can figure this out.",2,female
1353,PEGGY CARTER, We’ll send out rescue ships. We’ll find you.,2,female
1354,PEGGY CARTER, I’m here.,2,female
1355,PEGGY CARTER, All right. A week Saturday. The Stork Club.,2,female
1356,PEGGY CARTER," 8:00 on the dot. If you’re three minutes late I’m leaving, do you understand?",2,female
1357,PEGGY CARTER, I’ll show you. I’ll show you everything. Just be there.,2,female
1358,COLONEL PHILLIPS, I see you’re breaking in the candidates. That’s good. You. Get over there in that line and stand at attention until somebody tells you what to do.,2,male
1359,COLONEL PHILLIPS," I guess I just don’t understand the European sense of humor, Doctor.",2,male
1360,COLONEL PHILLIPS," When you invited a ninety-pound asthmatic onto my Army base, I let it slide because I assumed he’d be useful to you. Like a gerbil. I never thought you’d pick him.",2,male
1361,COLONEL PHILLIPS, Do you know how long it took to set up this project? The groveling I had to do  in front of Senator Brandt’s committee?,2,male
1362,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Hodge passed every test we gave him. He’s big, he’s fast, and he takes orders. In short, he’s a soldier.",2,male
1363,COLONEL PHILLIPS," You don’t win wars with niceness, Doctor. You win them with guts.",2,male
1364,COLONEL PHILLIPS, Senator Brandt. Glad you could make it.,2,male
1365,COLONEL PHILLIPS," We needed access to the city’s power grid. Of course, if you’d given us the generator I requisitioned...",2,male
1366,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Sorry you got up early now, Senator?",2,male
1367,COLONEL PHILLIPS, Great. Why don’t we start with how a German spy got a ride to my secret installation in your car?,2,male
1368,COLONEL PHILLIPS, Hydra.,2,male
1369,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Hydra’s practically a cult. They worship Schmidt, think he’s invincible.",2,male
1370,COLONEL PHILLIPS," I spoke to the President this morning. As of today, the SSR’s being re-tasked.",2,male
1371,COLONEL PHILLIPS," We’re taking the fight to Hydra. Pack your bags, Agent. You, too, Stark. The three of us fly to London tonight.",2,male
1372,COLONEL PHILLIPS, You’re an experiment. We’re sending you to Alamogordo.,2,male
1373,COLONEL PHILLIPS, I asked for an army. All I got is you. And you are not enough.,2,male
1374,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Well, if it isn’t “the starspangled man with the plan.” What is your plan exactly?",2,male
1375,COLONEL PHILLIPS," You don’t get to give me orders, “Captain.”",2,male
1376,COLONEL PHILLIPS, You and I are going to have a conversation later that you won’t enjoy-,2,male
1377,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Do not spell at me, son.",2,male
1378,COLONEL PHILLIPS, Barnes?,2,male
1379,COLONEL PHILLIPS, Yeah. It’s called “winning the war.”,2,male
1380,COLONEL PHILLIPS," They’re thirty miles behind the lines. Through some of the most heavily fortified territory in Europe. We’d lose more men than we’d save. I don’t expect you to understand that, because you are a chorus girl.",2,male
1381,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Then understand it somewhere else. If I read the posters right, you’ve got some place to be in a half- hour.",2,male
1382,COLONEL PHILLIPS, You got something to say now’s the time to keep it to yourself.,2,male
1383,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Senator Brandt, I regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the 3rd of last week.",2,male
1384,COLONEL PHILLIPS, Corporal. Why don’t you go get a cup of coffee?,2,male
1385,COLONEL PHILLIPS, I can probably make it so that you’ll avoid a court martial.,2,male
1386,COLONEL PHILLIPS, What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions?,2,male
1387,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Well, I hope that’s a great comfort to you when they shut this division down.",2,male
1388,COLONEL PHILLIPS, That won’t be necessary.,2,male
1389,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Just how many orders do you plan on disobeying, Captain?",2,male
1390,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Faith, huh?",2,male
1391,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Rogers, you just embarrassed a senior senator in front of a dozen reporters and ten members of Parliament.",2,male
1392,COLONEL PHILLIPS, These are all of Hydra’s factories.,2,male
1393,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6. I want every Allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.",2,male
1394,COLONEL PHILLIPS," We’re going to light a fire under Johann Schmidt’s ass. What do you say, Rogers? It’s your map. Think you can wipe Hydra off it?",2,male
1395,COLONEL PHILLIPS, We’ve already started lining up the best men-,2,male
1396,COLONEL PHILLIPS, It’s a steak.,2,male
1397,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Cow? Doctor, do you have any idea how hard it is to get hold of a prime cut like this out here?",2,male
1398,COLONEL PHILLIPS, Ever?,2,male
1399,COLONEL PHILLIPS, How about cyanide? Does that give you a rumbly tummy too?,2,male
1400,COLONEL PHILLIPS, I bought you dinner!,2,male
1401,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Sent that to DC this morning. Of course, it was encoded-say, you haven’t broken those codes, have you? That’d be awkward...",2,male
1402,COLONEL PHILLIPS," He’s still gonna kill you. You’re a liability, Doc. You know more about Schmidt than anyone.",2,male
1403,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Huh. You do realize that’s nuts, don’t you?",2,male
1404,COLONEL PHILLIPS, And why’s that?,2,male
1405,COLONEL PHILLIPS, What’s his target?,2,male
1406,COLONEL PHILLIPS, Johann Schmidt belongs in the bughouse. He thinks he’s a god and he’s going to blow up half the world to prove it.,2,male
1407,COLONEL PHILLIPS," According to my new best friend, under twenty-four hours.",2,male
1408,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Hydra’s last base is here, in the Alps... Five hundred feet below the surface.",2,male
1409,COLONEL PHILLIPS, You heard him! Move out!,2,male
1410,COLONEL PHILLIPS, Let’s go find two more.,2,male
1411,COLONEL PHILLIPS, Get in.,2,male
1412,COLONEL PHILLIPS, I’m not kissing you!,2,male
1413,COLONEL PHILLIPS," ALT. No one said we have to forget the man, Agent.",2,male
1414,COLONEL PHILLIPS, General Patton has said that “wars are fought with weapons and won by men.”,2,male
1415,COLONEL PHILLIPS, We’re going to win this war because we have the best men... And because they are going to get better. Much better.,2,male
1416,COLONEL PHILLIPS, He’s going to be the first of a new breed of super soldiers. And they are personally going to escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell. ALT. He’s going to be the first of a new breed of super soldiers. And together they’re going to bring a quick end to this damn war.,2,male
1417,COLONEL PHILLIPS," You’re not thinking of picking Rogers, are you?",2,male
1418,COLONEL PHILLIPS," You put a needle in that guy’s arm, it’s gonna come out the other side.",2,male
1419,COLONEL PHILLIPS, Look at him! He’s making me cry.,2,male
1420,COLONEL PHILLIPS, GRENADE!,2,male
1421,COLONEL PHILLIPS, What’ve we got?,2,male
1422,COLONEL PHILLIPS, I’m sure you’ve read our briefings.,2,male
1423,COLONEL PHILLIPS, I’ve signed more condolence letters today than I’d care to count. But the name does sound familiar. I’m sorry. ALT.,2,male
1424,COLONEL PHILLIPS, I’ve written more letters to more mothers than I care to count. I’m sorry. But the name does sound familiar.,2,male
1425,COLONEL PHILLIPS," Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful. As a result, I must declare Captain Rogers killed in action.",2,male
1426,COLONEL PHILLIPS, I can’t touch Stark. He’s a civilian...and the Army’s number one weapons contractor. You’re neither.,2,male
1427,COLONEL PHILLIPS," I took a chance on you, Agent Carter. Now that boy-and a lot of other men-are dead, because you had a crush.",2,male
1428,COLONEL PHILLIPS, What the hell’s going on out there?,2,male
1429,COLONEL PHILLIPS, You should get a medal just for that.,2,male

1716,TONY," “Iron Man”.  Not technically accurate, since it’s mostly carbon- fiber and ceramic.  But I like the ring of it.",1,male
1717,TONY, You know...that night at the concert hall.  Do you ever think about it?,1,male
1718,TONY, That will be all Miss Potts.,1,male
1719,TONY, I’ve seen the papers.  I’ve heard the reports.  That’s why I want to put an end to all this wild speculation.  The truth is--,1,male
1720,TONY, I am Iron Man.,1,male

1724,RHODEY, Yeah.  They said you’d be deeply honored if I presented.,1,male
1725,RHODEY, A lot of people would kill to have their name on that award.,1,male
1726,RHODEY," What’s wrong with you?  A thousand people came here tonight to honor you, and you leave them with egg on their face.  This award means something, Tony, it’s bigger than you --",1,male
1727,RHODEY, ...you just blew three million.,1,male
1728,RHODEY, Everything’s funny to you.,1,male
1729,RHODEY, We’ve got a hell of a day tomorrow. Can we get out of here now?,1,male
1730,RHODEY," You don’t get it.  I don’t work for the military because they paid for my education, or my father’s education.  Don’t cheapen it like that.",1,male
1731,RHODEY," ‘Straight-jacket’?  This uniform means something.  A chance to make a difference.  You don’t respect that, because you don’t understand.",1,male

1736,RHODEY, That’s funny.,1,male
1737,RHODEY, Something’s not right.,1,male
1738,RHODEY," Sir, I’m telling you, this was a snatch and grab.  A perfectly executed linear ambush.  As soon as they got what they wanted, they melted away.",1,male
1739,RHODEY, With your permission I’d like to stay in theater and head up the search and investigation.,1,male
1740,RHODEY," Tony Stark is the DOD’s number one intellectual asset, and I can be of value in the field.",1,male

1744,RHODEY," Are you blocking my transfer, Sir?",1,male
1745,RHODEY," I am, Sir.",1,male

1749,RHODEY," Manned or unmanned, which is the future of air combat?  For my money, no drone, no computer will ever trump a pilot’s instincts. His reflexes, his judgement--",1,male

1751,RHODEY, All right -- let’s wrap it up.,1,male
1752,RHODEY, I didn’t think I’d be seeing you for a while.,1,male

1754,RHODEY," You’ve been through a lot, thought you should get your head straight.",1,male
1755,RHODEY, Really?,1,male
1756,RHODEY, Lot of people around here will be happy to hear that.  What you said at that press conference really threw everyone.,1,male
1757,RHODEY, No you don’t.  You took a bad hit. It spun you around.,1,male
1758,RHODEY, All right then.  Good seeing you.,1,male
1759,RHODEY," I don’t think it’s Russian, or Chinese.",1,male
1760,RHODEY, Let me make a call.,1,male

1772,RHODEY, Look at you...what were you thinking?,1,male
1773,RHODEY, You can’t go around and blow up stuff every time you see something you don’t like on TV.,1,male
1774,RHODEY," You got lucky, next time they’ll blow you to pieces.",1,male
1775,RHODEY, Does Pepper know about this?,1,male
1776,RHODEY, You’ve put me in a tough spot here. What am I supposed to do?,1,male
1777,RHODEY, Don’t you get it?  It’s not up to us to decide.,1,male
1778,RHODEY," What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed?  Slow down.  Why would Obadiah-- (listens)  Where is Tony now?",1,male
1779,RHODEY, TONY--,1,male
1780,RHODEY," Don’t worry, she’s with the Feds. They’re on their way to Stark to arrest Obadiah.",1,male
1781,RHODEY," --I can confirm that a series of military test-prototypes were involved in the incident at Stark Industries last night.  I can also confirm that there was, for a brief time, the danger of an Ark Reactor “incident”, which was rectified without injury to the public -- and all power outages have been restored.  Here now, to answer a few brief questions, is Tony Stark.",1,male
1782,RHODEY, Good.  And I want a Gatling gun on the right shoulder.,1,male

1802,OBADIAH, See this.  Huh.  Huh.,1,male
1803,OBADIAH," Tony, thought we were meeting at the hospital.  You know there’s a lot of reporters in there.  What’s going on?",1,male
1804,OBADIAH," Okay, I think we’re going to be selling a lot of newspapers here.",1,male
1805,OBADIAH, Well that went well.  You just painted targets on our heads.  Our stock is going to take a 40 point dive tomorrow.,1,male
1806,OBADIAH, Like what?,1,male
1807,OBADIAH, This?  This was a publicity stunt. It’s not even cost effective.  We knew that before we built it. Repulsor technology is a dead end.,1,male
1808,OBADIAH, Oh my God.  It is a miracle you are alive. What must have happened to you over there?,1,male
1809,OBADIAH, That’s great.  Get me the design as soon as you can.  We’ve got a hungry production line that knock out a prototype in days.,1,male
1810,OBADIAH," Listen, I have something to talk to you about.  I really wish you’d attended the last board meeting like I asked you to.",1,male

1813,OBADIAH," They’re going to try. We’ll fight them, of course.",1,male
1814,OBADIAH," I don’t know.  Somehow they pulled enough votes together.  Listen, the world doesn’t share your vision, Tony.  The more people have to lose, the more frightened they are of new ideas.",1,male
1815,OBADIAH," Now listen, I don’t want you to get all in knots.  You know how many times I protected your father from the wolves?",1,male
1816,OBADIAH," Get back to your lab and work some magic.  You let me handle the board. Oh and Tony, no more press conferences.",1,male
1817,OBADIAH, What are you doing here?  I thought you were going to lay low.,1,male
1818,OBADIAH," Let’s just take it slow, okay.  I got the board right where we want them.",1,male
1819,OBADIAH," Is this like a tick for you? Whenever you have a feeling, you start going to all the people who don’t trust you, who don’t protect you.  They’re going to put a spin on everything you say.",1,male
1820,OBADIAH," Are you out of your mind.  You’re messing with the “guys in the rooms”, we’re talking about billion dollar interests, the world order --",1,male

1826,OBADIAH, It’s the only way I could protect you.,1,male
1827,OBADIAH," If you’d killed him when you were supposed to, you’d still have a face.",1,male
1828,OBADIAH, I think it’s best we don’t get him involved in this. (then)  I’ve come a long way to see this weapon. Show me.,1,male
1829,OBADIAH, ...so this is how he did it.,1,male
1830,OBADIAH, What’s this?,1,male
1831,OBADIAH, This...is the only gift you shall receive.,1,male

1841,OBADIAH, You and everyone else.,1,male

1845,OBADIAH," This company has a bright future, I’d like you to be a part of it.",1,male
1846,OBADIAH, Tony doesn’t understand your value. He never did.,1,male
1847,OBADIAH," Think about it. (then) Come on, I’ll walk you out.",1,male
1848,OBADIAH, It’s UNOS.  Four cheese.  I just had it flown in from Chicago.,1,male
1849,OBADIAH, I’d like you to proof-read something for me.,1,male
1850,OBADIAH, Can you turn him off?  All the way?,1,male
1851,OBADIAH, You were right.  It’s not my company -- not my name on the building.,1,male
1852,OBADIAH, Tony.  Please.  I’ll be out of here in a minute.,1,male
1853,OBADIAH, We have too much history to part on bad terms.  I’d like your blessing.,1,male
1854,OBADIAH," People are always going to die, Tony -- part of the chess game.",1,male
1855,OBADIAH," So this is the answer, Tony?  This is how you’re going to save the world?  It’s not in you.  Your father told me before he died, my boy doesn’t have a warrior’s heart. I should have listened.",1,male
1856,OBADIAH, But I do.,1,male
1857,OBADIAH," Goodbye, my boy...",1,male

1874,PEPPER, So that’s it?  Everyone’s pulling the plug and moving on...,1,female
1875,PEPPER, Spare me.  I read the official e- mail.  Thought maybe you’d have something different to say.,1,female

1884,PEPPER," Well, great, I’ll let him know--",1,female
1885,PEPPER, I’m sure he will.  Now if you could just take your seat.,1,female
1886,PEPPER, You mean that?  Or is this some clever stock-maneuver?,1,female
1887,PEPPER, Yes.  I remember.  What can I do for you?,1,female
1888,PEPPER, I know this is a priority for him. The next few weeks are a bit up in the air and I can’t set appointments without speaking with him first.,1,female

1974,CHRISTINE, You’ve been described as a Da Vinci for our times.  What do you say to that?,1,female
1975,CHRISTINE, And what do you say to your other nickname: “The Merchant of Death?”,1,female
1976,CHRISTINE, Brown.,1,female
1977,CHRISTINE," Rehearse that much, Mr. Stark?",1,female
1978,CHRISTINE," I’m sorry, “Tony”, I was hoping for a serious answer.",1,female
1979,CHRISTINE," Good line, coming from the guy selling the sticks.",1,female
1980,CHRISTINE, Others might call it war- profiteering.,1,female
1981,CHRISTINE, Wow.  You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?,1,female
1982,CHRISTINE," Look, Tony wanted me to stay for breakfast, but I’ve got to get a jump on the day.  Call me a cab, would you?",1,female
1983,CHRISTINE," And a coffee, hon.  Black.  One Splenda.",1,female
1984,CHRISTINE, Mr. Stark! I was hoping I could get a reaction from you.,1,female
1985,CHRISTINE, I was referring to your company’s involvement in this latest atrocity.,1,female
1986,CHRISTINE, Is this what you call accountability?,1,female
1987,CHRISTINE," Yesterday.  Good P.R. move, you tell the world you’re a changed man, even I believed you.",1,female
1988,CHRISTINE, Well your company did.,1,female

1991,JARVIS," That flight yielded excellent data, Sir.",1,male

1993,JARVIS," Sir, the suit has not even passed a basic wind-tunnel test.",1,male
1994,JARVIS, I suggest you allow me to employ Directive Four.,1,male

1997,JARVIS," Acknowledge, Mr. Stark--",1,male

1999,JARVIS, Temporary power restored.  Descend immediately.,1,male
2000,JARVIS," May I remind you, the suit feeds off the same power source as your life-support.  A zero-drain of RT will likely kill you.",1,male
2001,JARVIS, Shall I take over?,1,male
2002,JARVIS," That was quite dangerous, Sir. Might I remind you, if the suit loses power, so does your heart.",1,male
2003,JARVIS, The suit isn’t rated for high altitude.  You’re expending eight percent power just heating and pressurizing.,1,male
2004,JARVIS," Shall I render, utilizing proposed specifications?",1,male
2005,JARVIS," The work could take till morning to complete, Sir.",1,male

2015,YINSEN," I’ve seen many wounds like this in my village.  The walking dead we called them, because it took a week for the barbs to reach vital organs.  I anchored a magnetic suspension system to the plate. It’s holding the shrapnel in place...at least for now.",1,male
2016,YINSEN," That’s right, smile. (then) We met once -- at a technical conference in Bern.",1,male

2019,YINSEN," Listen to me, whatever they ask you, refuse.  You understand?  You must refuse.",1,male
2020,YINSEN," He says welcome Tony Stark, the greatest mass murderer in the history of America.  He is very honored.",1,male
2021,YINSEN, You will build for him Jericho missile you were demonstrating.,1,male
2022,YINSEN," You refuse?  You will do everything he says.  This is the great Abu Bakar.  You’re alive only because of his generosity.  You are nothing.  NOTHING.  He offers you his hospitality, and you answer only with insolence  He will not be refused.  You will die in a pool of your own blood.",1,male

2029,YINSEN," You don’t like what you saw out there, did you?  I didn’t like it either when those weapons destroyed my village.

Or are you going to try to do something about it?",1,male

2031,YINSEN, You do know they’ve removed all the explosives before they brought this to us.,1,male
2032,YINSEN, Eleven?,1,male
2033,YINSEN, How will I know when it reaches that temperature?,1,male
2034,YINSEN, Relax.  I always had steady hands. It’s why you’re still alive.,1,male
2035,YINSEN, My name is Yinsen.,1,male
2036,YINSEN, Nice to meet you too.,1,male
2037,YINSEN, What are you building?,1,male
2038,YINSEN," Look like an animal, and soon you’ll start behaving like one.",1,male
2039,YINSEN, That doesn’t look like a Jericho missile.,1,male
2040,YINSEN, What an original invention.,1,male
2041,YINSEN," It’s pretty small, what can it generate?",1,male
2042,YINSEN, That could run your heart for fifty lifetimes.,1,male
2043,YINSEN," Stark, tell me what you’re doing, and I’ll tell you what I’m doing.",1,male
2044,YINSEN, Crappy?  This is Lebanese cedar.,1,male
2045,YINSEN," I’m impressed you even know what this is. (then) How about we play, and if I win,  you tell me what you’re really making.",1,male
2046,YINSEN," Interesting, I was the champion at Cambridge.",1,male
2047,YINSEN, It’s a university. You probably haven’t heard about it since Americans can’t get in.,1,male
2048,YINSEN, Nothing.  We’re working.,1,male
2049,YINSEN, He’s working very hard.  It’s very complex.,1,male
2050,YINSEN, Nothing!  NOTHING is going on.,1,male
2051,YINSEN, He’s building your bomb.,1,male
2052,YINSEN, That’s twice I saved your life. Now are you going to tell me what the hell you’re really building?,1,male
2053,YINSEN," Finally, an idea of your own.",1,male
2054,YINSEN, Then perhaps it’s time we settle another matter...,1,male
2055,YINSEN," Ah, anchoring with 13-7.  You know, I have never met anyone who understands the nuances of this game like you.",1,male
2056,YINSEN, I come from a small village not far from here.  It was a good place... before these men ravaged it.,1,male
2057,YINSEN," When I get out of here, I am going to see them again. (then)  Do you have family, Stark?",1,male
2058,YINSEN, You’re a man who has everything and nothing.,1,male

2060,YINSEN," No, they’re moving.  Very slow.",1,male
2061,YINSEN, STOP!  STOP!,1,male
2062,YINSEN, I am going to see them again. They’re waiting for me.,1,male

2080,RAZA, Come.  Leave your guards outside.,1,male
2081,RAZA, His escape bore unexpected fruit.,1,male
2082,RAZA, This is only a crude first effort. But he’s perfected his design--,1,male
2083,RAZA, The inside of Tony Stark’s mind.,1,male
2084,RAZA, Everything you will need to build this weapon.,1,male
2085,RAZA, Stark has made a masterpiece of death.  A man with a dozen of these could rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.  And you dream of Stark’s throne -- we have a common enemy.,1,male
2086,RAZA," If we are back in business, I give you these designs as my gift.  In turn, I hope you will repay me with a gift of iron soldiers.",1,male

2110,COULSON, What was that?,1,male
2111,COULSON, Agent Coulson.,1,male

2113,COULSON, Ms. Potts.  It’s Agent Coulson from the Strategic Homeland Inter--,1,male
2114,COULSON, Really?  And why is that?,1,male
2115,COULSON, Maybe I can meet with you instead?,1,male
2116,COULSON," Let’s just put something on the books.  How about (checks his calendar) the twenty-eighth?  Seven PM, at Stark Industries?",1,male
2117,COULSON," Miss Potts, did you forget our appointment?",1,male

2121,JARVIS," I’m not sure I follow, Sir.",1,male
2122,JARVIS, What were your intentions for this device?,1,male
2123,JARVIS, It is difficult to offer counsel in light of the fact that your stated intentions are inconsistent with your actions.,1,male
2124,JARVIS, The energy yeild of this device outperforms your stated intention by eleven orders of magnitude. You could accomplish your stated goal with the power output of a car battery.,1,male
2125,JARVIS, Why are you talking to me like a computer?,1,male
2126,JARVIS, Shall I disable random pattern conversation?,1,male

2136,MAJOR ALLEN, Then where did it come from?,1,male
2137,MAJOR ALLEN, Rhodes!  You got something for me?,1,male
2138,MAJOR ALLEN, What is it then?,1,male
2139,MAJOR ALLEN, Viper 2: re-engage.,1,male

2141,MAJOR ALLEN, We’ll find out when recover the pieces.,1,male

2144,MAJOR ALLEN, Viper 2.  Can you confirm the kill?,1,male
2145,JANE, Hurry!,3,female
2146,JANE," It's a little different each time. Once it looked like, I don't know, melted stars, pooling in a corner of the sky. But last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon--",3,female
2147,JANE," Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and my gloves, will you?",3,female
2148,JANE, Thank you.,3,female
2149,JANE, The benefit of the doubt. The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.,3,female
2150,JANE," Sure, if you like rocking out to KFRM, ""All agriculture, all the time.""¬ù",3,female
2151,JANE," The anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms. She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book, tracking occurrences and patterns.",3,female
2152,JANE, There's got to be some new variable... Or an equipment malfunction...,3,female
2153,JANE, What?!,3,female
2154,JANE, Holy. Shatner.,3,female
2155,JANE, No-- yes! Let's go!,3,female
2156,JANE, Isn't this great?! A thought strikes her.,3,female
2157,JANE, You've gotta get us closer so I can take a magnetic reading. Darcy laughs.,3,female
2158,JANE, You want those college credits or not?,3,female
2159,JANE, What are you doing?!,3,female
2160,JANE," Get the first aid kit. Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively. She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome, long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing the life back into him.",3,female
2161,JANE, HIS EYES--,3,female
2162,JANE, --are dilating. That's a good sign.,3,female
2163,JANE, After we get a reading on the storm?,3,female
2164,JANE," Where did he come from? They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last glowing remnants of the storm, and into:",3,female
2165,JANE," Where did he come from? They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again. He sits up abruptly, and Jane topples backwards in surprise. Thor staggers groggily to his feet, then turns and offers Jane a hand up. She takes it hesitantly, and he easily pulls her up. She can't help but marvel at his strength.",3,female
2166,JANE," Erik... look at this. He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look. Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them away.",3,female
2167,JANE, Not right now. It'll take too long. County's an hour away. We'll drop him off after we're done here.,3,female
2168,JANE," Okay, you and Darcy take him to the hospital, I'll stay here.",3,female
2169,JANE," Erik, just back away...",3,female
2170,JANE," He said it was ""Thor.""¬ù The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.",3,female
2171,JANE, I've never met him before.,3,female
2172,JANE," Grazed him, actually.",3,female
2173,JANE," I told you, I don't know him. I just want to make sure he's okay.",3,female
2174,JANE, Jane Foster.,3,female
2175,JANE," Darcy, when you're done, take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology. Remind him, he owes me.",3,female
2176,JANE," ""We?""¬ù",3,female
2177,JANE, You know what would be really useful? Do you still have that friend at LIGO?,3,female
2178,JANE, Could you call in a favor?,3,female
2179,JANE," If I'm right, their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night's event.",3,female
2180,JANE, Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger.,3,female
2181,JANE, I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.,3,female
2182,JANE, She was the only applicant.,3,female
2183,JANE, A wormhole.,3,female
2184,JANE," Yes. But not our stars. She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her excitement.",3,female
2185,JANE, I think I left something at the hospital.,3,female
2186,JANE," But... I'm his wife. Darcy stifles a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse looks doubtful.",3,female
2187,JANE," I meant I barely know him anymore. The man he's become. He's changed. I mean, what woman really knows her husband, anyway?",3,female
2188,JANE, Typical. I just lost my most important piece of evidence.,3,female
2189,JANE, We find him.,3,female
2190,JANE," I want to know what that thing was, and he may have the answers. We don't have a choice.",3,female
2191,JANE," However long it takes. Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --",3,female
2192,JANE, I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing that on purpose.,3,female
2193,JANE, Let's get you some clothes.,3,female
2194,JANE," Excuse me... excuse me! She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads: ""HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE""¬ù. Thor looks at it, puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.",3,female
2195,JANE, You're welcome. Now tell me... Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to his form in the Bifrost photo.,3,female
2196,JANE, What exactly is the Bifrost?,3,female
2197,JANE, BUT--,3,female
2198,JANE," Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night. Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets flustered, looks away.",3,female
2199,JANE," Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.",3,female
2200,JANE, What was that?,3,female
2201,JANE, Then you should just say so!,3,female
2202,JANE, I mean ask for it. Nicely.,3,female
2203,JANE," All right, then no more smashing, deal?",3,female
2204,JANE, Good.,3,female
2205,JANE," Excuse me, did you say there was a satellite crash?",3,female
2206,JANE, Where are you going?,3,female
2207,JANE, Why?,3,female
2208,JANE, So now you own a satellite?,3,female
2209,JANE," Whatever it is, the government seems to think it's theirs. You intend to just walk in there and take it?",3,female
2210,JANE, Everything?,3,female
2211,JANE, You know what we saw last night. This can't be a coincidence. I want to know what's in that crater.,3,female
2212,JANE, He's promised us answers.,3,female
2213,JANE," I'd just be driving him out there, that's all.",3,female
2214,JANE, I'm sorry. I can't take you.,3,female
2215,JANE, That's... thank you. Thor bows slightly to each of them.,3,female
2216,JANE, Hey! That's my stuff!,3,female
2217,JANE, What the hell is going on here?! The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.,3,female
2218,JANE," I don't care who you work for, you can't do this!",3,female
2219,JANE, Let it go?! This is my life!,3,female
2220,JANE," By ""appropriate""¬ù you mean ""steal?""¬ù Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.",3,female
2221,JANE, I can't just pick up replacements from RadioShack! I made most of that equipment myself!,3,female
2222,JANE, And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!,3,female
2223,JANE, So are we! We're on the verge of,3,female
2224,JANE," Everything I know about this phenomenon is in this lab and in this book, and no one has the right to take it from me. Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's carrying. Jane is stunned.",3,female
2225,JANE," Years of research, gone.",3,female
2226,JANE, Look around! They took our back- ups. They took the back-ups of our back-ups.,3,female
2227,JANE, Will you please stop talking about your iPod?!,3,female
2228,JANE, I'm not going to let them do this. I'm getting everything back.,3,female
2229,JANE, You still want a lift?,3,female
2230,JANE, I've never done anything like this before! Have you ever done anything like this before? Thor looks amused by her excitement.,3,female
2231,JANE, They just stole my entire life's work. I really don't have anything left to lose.,3,female
2232,JANE," ""This Realm?""¬ù Why do you talk like that?",3,female
2233,JANE, Yeah. Just a little.,3,female
2234,JANE," I'm not quite sure yet. She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car.",3,female
2235,JANE, You promised me answers.,3,female
2236,JANE, A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?,3,female
2237,JANE," God, I hope you're not crazy.",3,female
2238,JANE," That isn't a satellite crash. They would have hauled the wreckage away, not built a city around it. Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.",3,female
2239,JANE, Why?--,3,female
2240,JANE," No! Look what's down there! You can't just walk in, grab our stuff, and walk out!",3,female
2241,JANE, Wait...,3,female
2242,JANE," Erik, okay, first of all, don't worry. I'm perfectly fine, really. More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base.",3,female
2243,JANE, No...,3,female
2244,JANE, I can't just leave him there.,3,female
2245,JANE, You didn't see what happened. Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book.,3,female
2246,JANE," Where did you find this? Selvig grabs the book from them, quickly closes it.",3,female
2247,JANE," Aren't you the one who's always told me to chase down all leads, all possibilities?",3,female
2248,JANE, Magic's just science we don't understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.,3,female
2249,JANE, The precursor of science fact.,3,female
2250,JANE," If that's really an Einstein-Rosen Bridge out there, then there's something on the other side.",3,female
2251,JANE, Yes! Exactly! Thank you! Darcy beams.,3,female
2252,JANE, Erik!,3,female
2253,JANE, What happened?,3,female
2254,JANE," Put him on the bed. Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.",3,female
2255,JANE," Well, it's more of a temporary living space, really. I don't usually have visitors in here. Actually, never... Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from him, puts it away.",3,female
2256,JANE, I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data. Or when Darcy's driving me crazy.,3,female
2257,JANE, I'm glad you're safe.,3,female
2258,JANE," I also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out. He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her",3,female
2259,JANE," I don't believe it... She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.",3,female
2260,JANE," No, this is good. Thank you. This means I don't have to start from scratch...",3,female
2261,JANE," SHIELD, whatever they are. They're never going to let this research see the light of day.",3,female
2262,JANE, Why?,3,female
2263,JANE, What is it?,3,female
2264,JANE, That would have been a thousand years ago? Northern Europe?,3,female
2265,JANE, What about you?,3,female
2266,JANE, Erik!,3,female
2267,JANE," What are you doing? What is that? As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it. Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound completely.",3,female
2268,JANE, Oh. My. God.,3,female
2269,JANE, Something's wrong.,3,female
2270,JANE, It's gone.,3,female
2271,JANE, Thanks.,3,female
2272,JANE, I know. But if he can't get here on his own...,3,female
2273,JANE, Oh-- watch your head.,3,female
2274,JANE," Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.",3,female
2275,JANE, Not until you see it!,3,female
2276,JANE, It's never taken this long before. Darcy calls up from the front seat.,3,female
2277,JANE," The last seventeen occurrences have been predictable to the minute... I just don't understand. Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror. She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.",3,female
2278,JANE," You're seeing it too, right? I'm not crazy?",3,female
2279,JANE," Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes and look at me. Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused, azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto them.",3,female
2280,JANE," Uh, thanks. Are you okay? Thor searches the ground.",3,female
2281,JANE, We've got to move fast before anything changes.,3,female
2282,JANE," We need soil samples, light readings, everything. She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at Thor, who stares up at the sky.",3,female
2283,JANE," Look at him, he's fine. Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily.",3,female
2284,JANE," Erik, look...",3,female
2285,JANE, What do you see here?,3,female
2286,JANE," This is the star alignment for our quadrant, this time of year. So unless Ursa Minor decided to take the day off... those are someone else's constellations. Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself. Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the image catches her eye.",3,female
2287,JANE, My ex.,3,female
2288,JANE, They're the only clothes I had that'll fit you. Sorry.,3,female
2289,JANE," What were you doing, in that? He glances at it, dismissive.",3,female
2290,JANE, Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.,3,female
2291,JANE, Maybe start with how you got inside that cloud.,3,female
2292,JANE, Sorry.,3,female
2293,JANE, Who are you? Really?,3,female
2294,JANE," But if you don't hear from me again, you might want to come out to the crater site and look for me. I kind of did what you said I shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye. She hangs up.",3,female
2295,JANE, Advanced beings could have come through it before.,3,female
2296,JANE, Can we go outside?,3,female
2297,JANE, ...maybe we can help him find his way back.,3,female
2298,SELVIG," Thanks. So what's this ""anomaly""¬ù of yours supposed to look like?",3,male
2299,SELVIG," ""Racing ""Àúround Orion?""¬ù I've always said you should have been a poet. Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.",3,male
2300,SELVIG, I recognize those. Think how proud he'd be to see you now. Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.,3,male
2301,SELVIG, For what?,3,male
2302,SELVIG," That's your ""subtle""¬ù aurora?!",3,male
2303,SELVIG, That's debateable. Put your seat belt on!,3,male
2304,SELVIG, We still have to get him to a hospital.,3,male
2305,SELVIG," Immediately, Jane. Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE above their heads. A thought strikes her.",3,male
2306,SELVIG," Jane, we need get him to a hospital.",3,male
2307,SELVIG," You expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert? Thor turns to the others, frustrated.",3,male
2308,SELVIG," It's all right, my friend. We're going to get you some help. Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows agitated, belligerent.",3,male
2309,SELVIG, You're in the desert outside the town of Puente Antiguo.,3,male
2310,SELVIG," Next time you decide to taser someone, do me a favor and make sure they're already inside the truck.",3,male
2311,SELVIG," Oh, for God's sake... He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his business card.",3,male
2312,SELVIG, We might want to perform a spectral analysis.,3,male
2313,SELVIG," I flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful. This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up, inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a rack-mounted server.",3,male
2314,SELVIG, She was more than a friend.,3,male
2315,SELVIG, You don't think this was just a magnetic storm?,3,male
2316,SELVIG, Meaning?,3,male
2317,SELVIG," How ""big""¬ù are we talking about? Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and covered with stars.",3,male
2318,SELVIG, I thought you were a science major.,3,male
2319,SELVIG," An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a ""theoretical""¬ù connection between two different points of space-time. Darcy stares blankly.",3,male
2320,SELVIG, Stars.,3,male
2321,SELVIG, Is that...?,3,male
2322,SELVIG, Did you see what he did in there? I don't know if finding him is the best idea.,3,male
2323,SELVIG, So we're just going to spend the rest of the day looking for him?,3,male
2324,SELVIG, The Bifrost...,3,male
2325,SELVIG, What did the satellite look like?,3,male
2326,SELVIG, Jane.,3,male
2327,SELVIG, I'm not talking about the crater. I'm talking about him.,3,male
2328,SELVIG," He's delusional! Listen to what he's saying! ""Thor.""¬ù ""Bifrost.""¬ù ""Mjolnir.""¬ù These are the stories I grew up with as a child!",3,male
2329,SELVIG, It's dangerous. He's dangerous.,3,male
2330,SELVIG, Now... let's get back to the lab. We have work to do. Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor as he walks away down the street.,3,male
2331,SELVIG, Jane. This is more serious than you realize. Let it go.,3,male
2332,SELVIG, And your back-ups?,3,male
2333,SELVIG," No one knows much about them. But I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up, and he was never heard from again.",3,male
2334,SELVIG," Please, let me contact one of my colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some dealings with these people. I'll e- mail him and see if he can help.",3,male
2335,SELVIG, I'll just be a minute. He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street and sees something that intrigues her.,3,male
2336,SELVIG, Why not?,3,male
2337,SELVIG, In the children's section. I wanted to show you how ridiculous his story was.,3,male
2338,SELVIG," I was talking about science, not magic!",3,male
2339,SELVIG, Who wrote science fiction.,3,male
2340,SELVIG, In some cases.,3,male
2341,SELVIG, Jane...,3,male
2342,SELVIG," Jane, if you do this, you'll find yourself in a situation that I won't be able to get you out of this time.",3,male
2343,SELVIG, Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of our team.,3,male
2344,SELVIG," Troubled, not dangerous. He was distraught when he found out that you'd taken all of our research. It was years of his life, gone! He got depressed, started drinking, and... well, you know the rest.",3,male
2345,SELVIG, Certainly.,3,male
2346,SELVIG, Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness nut.,3,male
2347,SELVIG," He is. That is, he was. He switched careers and became a physicist. He's quite brilliant, really.",3,male
2348,SELVIG, Thank you.,3,male
2349,SELVIG," Donny, Donny, Donny! There you are!",3,male
2350,SELVIG, I will!,3,male
2351,SELVIG, To get a drink.,3,male
2352,SELVIG," Seems Darcy's a terrible intern, but a talented hacker.",3,male
2353,SELVIG, Don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.,3,male
2354,SELVIG, Of course not! Jane's like a daughter to me. Her father and I taught at University together.,3,male
2355,SELVIG," I don't know if you're really delusional, and I really don't care at this point. I just care about her. I've seen the way she looks at you.",3,male
2356,SELVIG," Good. If that's the case, then I'll buy you one more drink, and you'll leave town tonight. A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.",3,male
2357,SELVIG," It's not a bad thing, finding out that you don't have all the answers. That's when you start asking the right questions. Thor takes this in.",3,male
2358,SELVIG, Anyone who's ever going to find their way in this world has to start by admitting they don't know where the hell they are. Thor nods.,3,male
2359,SELVIG," Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our heads.",3,male
2360,SELVIG, I still don't believe you're the God of Thunder.,3,male
2361,SELVIG, I need some coffee. The three head inside Smith Motors.,3,male
2362,SELVIG, I don't believe it...,3,male
2363,SELVIG, Go! Leave me!,3,male
2364,SELVIG, I'm really starting to like him. Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.,3,male
2365,SELVIG," Jane, no!",3,male
2366,SELVIG, Jane?,3,male
2367,DARCY, Jane?,3,female
2368,DARCY, I don't think there's anything wrong with your equipment... The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.,3,female
2369,DARCY, I think you want to see this. Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over the desert --,3,female
2370,DARCY," Yeah, right! Good one! Oh God, you're serious...",3,female
2371,DARCY, Keep the credits. I'll intern at Burger King.,3,female
2372,DARCY," Saving our lives! Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --",3,female
2373,DARCY, I think that was legally your fault.,3,female
2374,DARCY, Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I know CPR.,3,female
2375,DARCY, --are beautiful.,3,female
2376,DARCY," Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. That's pretty obvious. Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines her flashlight down at the sand.",3,female
2377,DARCY," Uh... New Mexico? Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon, unsure what to make of it.",3,female
2378,DARCY, What? He was freaking me out.,3,female
2379,DARCY, Until she hit him with the car.,3,female
2380,DARCY, A what?,3,female
2381,DARCY, Political Science. Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.,3,female
2382,DARCY," Hey, check it out. Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.",3,female
2383,DARCY, So now what?,3,female
2384,DARCY, Oo-kay.,3,female
2385,DARCY, I think you may have hit him with the car one time too many.,3,female
2386,DARCY," You know, for a crazy homeless guy, he's pretty cut. Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a t-shirt.",3,female
2387,DARCY, And how you could eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts and still be this hungry.,3,female
2388,DARCY," Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Isabela makes the best coffee in town.",3,female
2389,DARCY," Oh my God, this is going on Facebook.",3,female
2390,DARCY," ""Myeu-muh?""¬ù What's ""Myeu-muh?""¬ù Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,",3,female
2391,DARCY, They even took my iPod.,3,female
2392,DARCY," I just downloaded, like, thirty songs on there.",3,female
2393,DARCY," They took your laptop, too. Annoyed, Selvig thinks.",3,female
2394,DARCY, Hey! Myeu-muh!,3,female
2395,DARCY, A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities.,3,female
2396,DARCY, I'll help you.,3,female
2397,DARCY, Thanks.,3,female
2398,DARCY, Sure.,3,female
2399,DARCY, Who are they?,3,female
2400,DARCY," Was somebody else coming? Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground.",3,female
2401,DARCY," So, how can you speak our language?",3,female
2402,DARCY, No.,3,female
2403,DARCY, Here you go.,3,female
2404,DARCY, He would have come back if he could.,3,female
2405,ODIN, Do you think he's ready?,3,male
2406,ODIN, He'll need his father's wisdom.,3,male
2407,ODIN," Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He could be a great King... Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating, trying to stop the strange event through the force of his sheer will.",3,male
2408,ODIN, I can fight it a little longer...,3,male
2409,ODIN," I've destroyed demons and monsters, devastated whole worlds, laid waste to mighty kingdoms, and still you worry for me?",3,male
2410,ODIN," Not today. Now come kiss your king... while I'm still king. He pulls her close, and they kiss.",3,male
2411,ODIN," Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a Ruler of Asgard. Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall, casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be seen. Odin looks to Loki.",3,male
2412,ODIN," Gungnir. Its aim is true, its power strong. With it I have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms since the time of the Great Beginning. And though the day has come for a new King to wield his own weapon -- that duty remains the same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my first-born.",3,male
2413,ODIN," Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms. The sacred throne of Asgard. I have sacrificed much to achieve peace. So, too, must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace. Responsibility, duty, honor. These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire. They are essential to every soldier and to every King. The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the hall.",3,male
2414,ODIN, Do you swear to preserve the peace?,3,male
2415,ODIN, Do you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and pledge yourself only to the good of all the Realms?,3,male
2416,ODIN," Then on this day, I, Odin Allfather, proclaim you-- Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE creeps across the surface of the large banners around the hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades, and the crowd see it too.",3,male
2417,ODIN," They have paid with their lives. The Destroyer did its job, and the Casket is safe. All is well.",3,male
2418,ODIN, But they didn't.,3,male
2419,ODIN, The Casket of Ancient Winters belonged to the Jotuns. They believe it's their birthright.,3,male
2420,ODIN," I have a truce with Laufey, the Jotun King.",3,male
2421,ODIN, Leave us.,3,male
2422,ODIN, You're thinking only as a warrior!,3,male
2423,ODIN," It was the act of but a few, doomed to fail.",3,male
2424,ODIN," We will find the breach in our defenses. It will be found, and it will be sealed.",3,male
2425,ODIN," You are not King. Not yet. Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin watches him go.",3,male
2426,ODIN, Laufey. End this.,3,male
2427,ODIN," You're right. These are the actions of a boy. Treat them as such. You and I can stop this before there's further bloodshed. Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice blade at the end of his arm.",3,male
2428,ODIN, So be it.,3,male
2429,ODIN, Silence!,3,male
2430,ODIN, Do you realize what you've done? What you've started?,3,male
2431,ODIN, You cannot protect your friends. How can you hope to protect a kingdom?,3,male
2432,ODIN, That's pride and vanity that talks! Not leadership!,3,male
2433,ODIN," You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!",3,male
2434,ODIN," A fool, yes! I was a fool to think you were ready.",3,male
2435,ODIN," Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed the express command of your King. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war. The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor. Odin turns angrily to his son.",3,male
2436,ODIN, Do you understand what he set in motion? He's taken us to the brink of war!,3,male
2437,ODIN, What would you have done?,3,male
2438,ODIN, That is why I'm King.,3,male
2439,ODIN, No. His fate is in his own hands now.,3,male
2440,ODIN," No. Put the Casket down. Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his father.",3,male
2441,ODIN, You're my son.,3,male
2442,ODIN, No.,3,male
2443,ODIN, You were an innocent child.,3,male
2444,ODIN," I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day, bring about an alliance, bring about a permanent peace... through you. But those plans no longer matter.",3,male
2445,ODIN, Why do you twist my words?,3,male
2446,ODIN, You are my son. My blood. I wanted only to protect you from the truth.,3,male
2447,ODIN, Don't...,3,male
2448,ODIN, Listen...,3,male
2449,ODIN, Listen to me!,3,male
2450,ODIN, It is over.,3,male
2451,ODIN, You'll be a wise King.,3,male
2452,ODIN," You've already made me proud. Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.",3,male
2453,FRIGGA, He thinks he is. He has his father's confidence.,3,female
2454,FRIGGA, And his humility? Odin reacts.,3,female
2455,FRIGGA," For once, our son needs something we cannot provide.",3,female
2456,FRIGGA, No. You've put it off too long! I worry for you.,3,female
2457,FRIGGA, Always.,3,female
2458,FRIGGA, It's all right to be nervous.,3,female
2459,FRIGGA, You may be able to fool the rest of,3,female
2460,FRIGGA," Thor, just remember that you have something even the great Allfather never had.",3,female
2461,FRIGGA, Me for a mother. She smiles.,3,female
2462,FRIGGA, How could you have done this?,3,female
2463,FRIGGA, But banishment? You would lose him forever? He's your son!,3,female
2464,FRIGGA," I would not have exiled him to a world of mortals, stripped of his powers, to suffer alone. I would not have had the heart for such cruelty!",3,female
2465,FRIGGA, You can bring him back.,3,female
2466,FRIGGA, I asked him to be honest with you from the beginning. There should be no secrets in a family.,3,female
2467,FRIGGA," He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different. You are in every way our son, Loki, and we your family. You must know that.",3,female
2468,FRIGGA, I don't know. This time is different. We were unprepared.,3,female
2469,FRIGGA," But he's put it off for so long now, I fear...",3,female
2470,FRIGGA, There's always a purpose to everything your father does. Thor may yet find a way home. Loki looks troubled by the revelation.,3,female
2471,FRIGGA," Thor is banished. The line of succession falls to you. Until he awakens, Asgard is yours.",3,female
2472,FRIGGA," Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back. She looks to Loki, takes him in her arms.",3,female
2473,FRIGGA, Thor!,3,female
2474,FRIGGA, What?,3,female
2475,FRIGGA," Thank you, Sif.",3,female
2476,FRIGGA, He will need his friends now more than ever.,3,female
2477,ODIN, ...if we only had more time.,3,male
2478,ODIN, Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased. A murmur spreads through the crowd.,3,male
2479,ODIN," So long entrusted with this mighty hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the heart of a dying star, from the sacred metal of Uru. Only one may lift it. Only one is worthy. Who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm. Its power has no equal -- as a weapon, to destroy, or as a tool, to build. It is a fit companion for a King.",3,male
2480,ODIN," Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard the Nine Realms?",3,male
2481,ODIN, Frost giants...,3,male
2482,ODIN, And what action would you take?,3,male
2483,ODIN," Get him to the healing room! Sif, Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help Fandral out of the room.",3,male
2484,ODIN," Have you forgotten everything I've taught you? What of a warrior's patience, cunning?",3,male
2485,ODIN, You are unworthy of this Realm... Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.,3,male
2486,ODIN, ...unworthy of your title... He rips away Thor's cloak.,3,male
2487,ODIN, ...unworthy of the loved ones you've betrayed. I hereby take from you your powers. Odin extends his hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes flying from Thor's grasp into Odin's hand.,3,male
2488,ODIN," In the name of my father... A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor, disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the chest piece.",3,male
2489,ODIN," ...and of his father before... Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor, including the cape and torn-away disc on the floor.",3,male
2490,ODIN, I cast you out!,3,male
2491,ODIN," Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.",3,male
2492,ODIN, Loki!,3,male
2493,THOR, Another!,3,male
2494,THOR, Have you ever known me to be nervous?,3,male
2495,THOR," That wasn't nerves, brother. It was the rage of battle. How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive?",3,male
2496,THOR," Some do battle, others just do tricks.",3,male
2497,THOR," You don't really want to start this again, do you, Cow?",3,male
2498,THOR, You're incapable of sincerity.,3,male
2499,THOR, Thank you.,3,male
2500,THOR, Stop.,3,male
2501,THOR, You go ahead.,3,male
2502,THOR, Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm not nervous!,3,male
2503,THOR, ...but never you. I know.,3,male
2504,THOR, And what is that?,3,male
2505,THOR, I swear.,3,male
2506,THOR, I swear.,3,male
2507,THOR, I swear.,3,male
2508,THOR, The Jotuns must pay for what they've done!,3,male
2509,THOR," ""All is well?!""¬ù They broke into the Weapons Vault! If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these",3,male
2510,THOR, I want to know why they--,3,male
2511,THOR, And if you hadn't taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the Nine Realms!,3,male
2512,THOR, He just broke your truce! We must act!,3,male
2513,THOR," March into Jotunheim as you once did, teach them a lesson, break their spirits so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again!",3,male
2514,THOR, This was an act of war!,3,male
2515,THOR, They got this far!,3,male
2516,THOR," As King of Asgard, I would--",3,male
2517,THOR," It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother.",3,male
2518,THOR, This was to be my day of triumph.,3,male
2519,THOR," Yes, exactly!",3,male
2520,THOR, It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.,3,male
2521,THOR, The safety of our Realm is no jest. We're going to Jotunheim.,3,male
2522,THOR," My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket! We'd just be looking for answers.",3,male
2523,THOR," My friends, have you forgotten all that we've done together? He turns to Fandral.",3,male
2524,THOR, Who led you into the most glorious of battles...,3,male
2525,THOR, And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known?,3,male
2526,THOR," True. But I supported you... My friends, trust me now. We must do this.",3,male
2527,THOR, You are coming with me...,3,male
2528,THOR, We must first find a way to get past Heimdall.,3,male
2529,THOR, Enough.,3,male
2530,THOR," Then tell no one where we've gone until we've returned. Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles him.",3,male
2531,THOR, I have no plans to die today.,3,male
2532,THOR," Come on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom, changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked off the platform and inside the vortex.",3,male
2533,THOR," Come on, big fella. Up...! With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:",3,male
2534,THOR, Too late now.,3,male
2535,THOR, For what?,3,male
2536,THOR, We know all we must. It's time to act.,3,male
2537,THOR," It feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world?",3,male
2538,THOR, What would you call it?,3,male
2539,THOR, How about a song to lift our spirits?,3,male
2540,THOR, Hiding. As cowards always do. Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza. Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.,3,male
2541,THOR, I speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers.,3,male
2542,THOR, And I am--,3,male
2543,THOR," I demand answers. Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.",3,male
2544,THOR, How did your people get into Asgard?,3,male
2545,THOR, Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies.,3,male
2546,THOR," Not when you'd use it to make war against other Realms. Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.",3,male
2547,THOR, This boy has grown tired of your mockery.,3,male
2548,THOR," Know your place, brother...",3,male
2549,THOR, Next!,3,male
2550,THOR," Come on! At least make it a challenge for me! He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor rises, grins.",3,male
2551,THOR, Come on!,3,male
2552,THOR, Then go!,3,male
2553,THOR, I can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all around them.,3,male
2554,THOR," Loki, we have to see. Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating. But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too many, even for a Thunder God.",3,male
2555,THOR, Now! We'll finish them together!,3,male
2556,THOR, Why did you bring us back?,3,male
2557,THOR, I was protecting my home.,3,male
2558,THOR, There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act! Odin stares at him.,3,male
2559,THOR," While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us! The old ways are done. You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls!",3,male
2560,THOR," And you are an old man and a fool! The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words.",3,male
2561,THOR, Hammer...,3,male
2562,THOR, Father! Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the bridge!,3,male
2563,THOR, You! What world is this? The group is intimidated by his fervor.,3,male
2564,THOR," Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it. Jane looks on, concerned.",3,male
2565,THOR, What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?,3,male
2566,THOR, You dare threaten Thor with so puny,3,male
2567,THOR, How dare you attack the son of Odin!,3,male
2568,THOR," Then bring me a healing stone, you savages!",3,male
2569,THOR," You're no match for the Mighty-- Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.",3,male
2570,THOR," It's not possible. He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands slips free from its restraint.",3,male
2571,THOR," Blue sky... one sun... This is Earth, isn't it?",3,male
2572,THOR, They will suffice. Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on the wall.,3,male
2573,THOR," What does anyone do in the Bifrost? Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word. Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within the book, curious.",3,male
2574,THOR, This mortal form has grown weak.,3,male
2575,THOR, This drink. I like it.,3,male
2576,THOR, Another!,3,male
2577,THOR, It was delicious. I want another.,3,male
2578,THOR, I just did.,3,male
2579,THOR, I meant no disrespect.,3,male
2580,THOR, You have my word.,3,male
2581,THOR, Where?!,3,male
2582,THOR, Twelve miles east of here. He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks with him.,3,male
2583,THOR, To get what belongs to me.,3,male
2584,THOR, It's not what they say it is.,3,male
2585,THOR, Yes.,3,male
2586,THOR," All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Darcy looks to the others.",3,male
2587,THOR, I understand. Then this is where we say goodbye.,3,male
2588,THOR, Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.,3,male
2589,THOR, I need a horse.,3,male
2590,THOR," Then give me one of those, large enough to ride.",3,male
2591,THOR, Many times. You're brave to do it.,3,male
2592,THOR, But you're clever. Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm.,3,male
2593,THOR," You think me strange? Jane laughs, catches herself.",3,male
2594,THOR, Good strange or bad strange?,3,male
2595,THOR, You'll see soon enough.,3,male
2596,THOR, What you seek -- it's a bridge.,3,male
2597,THOR, More like a rainbow bridge.,3,male
2598,THOR, You're going to need this.,3,male
2599,THOR," Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I will return what they stole from you.",3,male
2600,THOR, No.,3,male
2601,THOR, You're big.,3,male
2602,THOR, Just a man.,3,male
2603,THOR, Loki? What are you doing here?,3,male
2604,THOR, What's happened? Tell me! Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to,3,male
2605,THOR, What?,3,male
2606,THOR, Can I come home?,3,male
2607,THOR, But couldn't we find a way to--,3,male
2608,THOR," No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you for coming here.",3,male
2609,THOR, Good-bye.,3,male
2610,THOR, Where are we going? Selvig drops his cool demeanor.,3,male
2611,THOR, Thank you for what you've done.,3,male
2612,THOR, Are you in love with her?,3,male
2613,THOR, Neither did I.,3,male
2614,THOR," I swear to you, I mean her no harm.",3,male
2615,THOR, I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong.,3,male
2616,THOR," For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.",3,male
2617,THOR, I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful.,3,male
2618,THOR, I will not fight him.,3,male
2619,THOR, Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his shoulder.,3,male
2620,THOR, He's fine. Not injured at all.,3,male
2621,THOR, We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud.,3,male
2622,THOR, These are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up the mess around her.,3,male
2623,THOR, You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve.,3,male
2624,THOR, It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry.,3,male
2625,THOR, What's wrong?,3,male
2626,THOR, You must do this. You must finish what you've started.,3,male
2627,THOR, Because you're right. It's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point. You're nearly there. You just need someone to show you how close you really are.,3,male
2628,THOR, This is how my father explained it to me...,3,male
2629,THOR, You're very welcome. Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates.,3,male
2630,THOR, May I have this?,3,male
2631,THOR, Thank you. Excuse me a moment. Thor leaves.,3,male
2632,THOR, To replace the one I broke. Please forgive my behavior.,3,male
2633,THOR," If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your ""coffee.""¬ù",3,male
2634,THOR, My friends!,3,male
2635,THOR," My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come.",3,male
2636,THOR, You know I can't. My father is dead because of me. I must remain in exile.,3,male
2637,THOR, Leave this town now. Get yourself and your friends to safety.,3,male
2638,THOR, I must stay and fight. The Asgardians look to Thor.,3,male
2639,THOR, You're right.,3,male
2640,THOR," My friends fight bravely, but they won't be able to hold it back much longer.",3,male
2641,THOR," Come on... give me one! Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over the end of the iron rod.",3,male
2642,THOR," Go, while you can!",3,male
2643,THOR, You can't help them now. Your job is to survive.,3,male
2644,THOR, Live and tell those stories yourself.,3,male
2645,THOR," But not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die!",3,male
2646,THOR, Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!,3,male
2647,THOR, He would open it if he could. I fear the worst.,3,male
2648,THOR, Heimdall!,3,male
2649,THOR," Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause -- the protection of this world. From this day forward, count me as your ally.",3,male
2650,THOR," Whatever fate lies before me, you are part of it.",3,male
2651,THOR, Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me.,3,male
2652,THOR, No thanks to you. Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.,3,male
2653,THOR," Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends? To kill me? Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.",3,male
2654,THOR," You're a talented liar, brother. Always have been.",3,male
2655,THOR, Jotunheim...,3,male
2656,THOR, Why have you done this?,3,male
2657,THOR, He won't! You can't kill an entire race!,3,male
2658,THOR, I've changed.,3,male
2659,THOR, Is the throne really worth what you've done? What you would become?,3,male
2660,THOR," I will not fight you, brother.",3,male
2661,THOR," Loki, this is madness... Loki grins.",3,male
2662,THOR," Yet still not clever enough. With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air, summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the Lokis.",3,male
2663,THOR, Forgive me.,3,male
2664,THOR, No!,3,male
2665,THOR, There will never be a wiser king than you. Or a better father.,3,male
2666,THOR," Can you see her? Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.",3,male
2667,THOR, How is she?,3,male
2668,LOKI, There was the time in Nornheim...,3,male
2669,LOKI," As I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape.",3,male
2670,LOKI," Just a bit of fun. Right, my friend? The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE- WINGED",3,male
2671,LOKI, Nice feathers.,3,male
2672,LOKI, I was being sincere!,3,male
2673,LOKI, Am I?,3,male
2674,LOKI, Give us a kiss.,3,male
2675,LOKI, Like a king.,3,male
2676,LOKI," He said he'd be along. Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.",3,male
2677,LOKI, I wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does.,3,male
2678,LOKI, Who said I was wise?,3,male
2679,LOKI, It will come. In time.,3,male
2680,LOKI," But there's nothing we can do without defying Father. Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye. Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.",3,male
2681,LOKI, It's madness!,3,male
2682,LOKI, Nothing! Thor was making a jest!,3,male
2683,LOKI, What?,3,male
2684,LOKI," Yes, of course! I won't let my brother march into Jotunheim alone. I will be at his side.",3,male
2685,LOKI," Keep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed. This is going to take subtlety and sincerity, not brute strength. Leave it to me. Loki dismounts and steps forward.",3,male
2686,LOKI, I'm sorry?,3,male
2687,LOKI, You must be mistaken. We're not--,3,male
2688,LOKI, Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth. Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.,3,male
2689,LOKI, Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns back to his brother.,3,male
2690,LOKI, To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.,3,male
2691,LOKI," Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered.",3,male
2692,LOKI, We will accept your most gracious offer.,3,male
2693,LOKI, Damn.,3,male
2694,LOKI, Pathetic.,3,male
2695,LOKI, That can't be good.,3,male
2696,LOKI," Thor, we must go! Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat of battle.",3,male
2697,LOKI," Likely killed us all! As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them. The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below. Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades.",3,male
2698,LOKI, FATHER--,3,male
2699,LOKI, I told him.,3,male
2700,LOKI, I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long.,3,male
2701,LOKI, I saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.,3,male
2702,LOKI," And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous.",3,male
2703,LOKI, Am I cursed?,3,male
2704,LOKI, What am I?,3,male
2705,LOKI," What more than that? Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened. Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.",3,male
2706,LOKI, Laufey's son...,3,male
2707,LOKI," You took me for a purpose, what was it?",3,male
2708,LOKI," So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me.",3,male
2709,LOKI, You could have told me what I was from the beginning. Why didn't you?,3,male
2710,LOKI, Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?,3,male
2711,LOKI, It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.,3,male
2712,LOKI," Because no matter how much you claim to ""love""¬ù me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard! Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries to fight it off.",3,male
2713,LOKI, Guards!,3,male
2714,LOKI, So why did he lie?,3,male
2715,LOKI, How long will it last?,3,male
2716,LOKI, I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.,3,male
2717,LOKI, What hope is there for Thor?,3,male
2718,LOKI," Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand. Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.",3,male
2719,LOKI, My friends... you haven't heard? I am now Ruler of Asgard.,3,male
2720,LOKI, Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. My mother fears he may never awaken again.,3,male
2721,LOKI," She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your ""urgent""¬ù matter to me, your King.",3,male
2722,LOKI," My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of this.",3,male
2723,LOKI, I had to see you.,3,male
2724,LOKI, Father is dead.,3,male
2725,LOKI," Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear.",3,male
2726,LOKI, The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.,3,male
2727,LOKI," Mother has forbidden your return. Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.",3,male
2728,LOKI," Nothing could have stopped me. Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.",3,male
2729,LOKI, I've come alone and unarmed.,3,male
2730,LOKI, To make you another proposition.,3,male
2731,LOKI, You're welcome.,3,male
2732,LOKI," You have no idea what I am. The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the guards stare in shock. Loki grins.",3,male
2733,LOKI," No longer weak. I now rule Asgard, until Odin awakens. Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me.",3,male
2734,LOKI," I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into his chambers, and let you slay him where he lies. I'll keep the throne, and you will have the Casket.",3,male
2735,LOKI," When all is done, we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds. Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could.",3,male
2736,LOKI," No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told. Laufey considers the proposition.",3,male
2737,LOKI," What troubles you, Gatekeeper?",3,male
2738,LOKI, Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.,3,male
2739,LOKI," You have great power, Heimdall. Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?",3,male
2740,LOKI, And why is that?,3,male
2741,LOKI, Exactly. Just as you're sworn to obey me now. Yes? A beat.,3,male
2742,LOKI, Good. Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started. Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after him.,3,male
2743,LOKI," You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King.",3,male
2744,LOKI, Ensure my brother does not return.,3,male
2745,LOKI, Father. Welcome to Asgard.,3,male
2746,LOKI, And your death came by the son of Odin.,3,male
2747,LOKI," I swear to you, mother, they will pay for what they've done today. I will end the Jotun threat, now and forever!",3,male
2748,LOKI," Found its way back to you, did it?",3,male
2749,LOKI, It must have been enforcing Father's last command.,3,male
2750,LOKI, It's good to have you back.,3,male
2751,LOKI," All these years, and no one's ever dared to use it as a weapon. Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor, blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the ice as Thor staggers to his feet.",3,male
2752,LOKI," To do what Father never could. To destroy their kind forever. When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done.",3,male
2753,LOKI," What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands.",3,male
2754,LOKI, So have I.,3,male
2755,LOKI, I never wanted the throne. I only wanted to be your equal. Now fight me!,3,male
2756,LOKI, I am not your brother. I never was.,3,male
2757,LOKI, Is it?,3,male
2758,LOKI," If you care so much for the Jotuns, then die with them. The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand towards the Bifrost. MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand. The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his brother.",3,male
2759,LOKI, Thor! Help me!,3,male
2760,LOKI," Look at you, the Mighty Thor. With all your strength, what good does it do you now? Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's happening.",3,male
2761,THOR, Loki...,3,male
2762,THOR, Now that was just a waste of good wine.,3,male
2763,THOR, How do I look?,3,male
2764,THOR, I'll be along. Go on. Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.,3,male
2765,THOR, Who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of Yggdrasil?,3,male
2766,THOR," Come on. You're not going to let my brother and me take all the glory, are you?",3,male
2767,THOR," Now that's more like it! He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute head over heels. Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies back to his grasp.",3,male
2768,THOR," Ugly and stupid. Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the ground by another. It raises its weapon above her. Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in the chest. The Jotun falls dead.",3,male
2769,THOR," Whatever the cost, the world must know that the new King of Asgard will not be held in contempt.",3,male
2770,THOR," If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know.",3,male
2771,THOR, Deal?,3,male
2772,THOR," I'm going to fly out. Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater. The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust.",3,male
2773,THOR, Fought bigger.,3,male
2774,THOR," Sorry, my friend.",3,male
2775,THOR," Look -- your ancestors called it magic. You call it science. I come from a place where they're one and the same thing. We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.",3,male
2776,THOR," She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their breakfast, looking like a little family.",3,male
2777,THOR," I'm still a warrior, and I will fight by your side.",3,male
2778,THOR, Help me clear the streets. I'll let none of these people die this day.,3,male
2779,THOR, Get him out of here!,3,male
2780,THOR," Don't worry, my friends. I have a plan.",3,male
2781,THOR," Brother... for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry. But these people have done nothing to you. They are innocents. He continues towards the Destroyer.",3,male
2782,THOR," Take my life, and know I will never return to Asgard.",3,male
2783,LOKI," I've looked forward to this day as long as you have. You're my brother and my friend. Sometimes I'm envious, but never doubt that I love you.",3,male
2784,LOKI, It's time.,3,male
2785,LOKI, No... stop there! I know that look!,3,male
2786,LOKI, GOOD HEIMDALL--,3,male
2787,LOKI, You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King?,3,male
2788,LOKI," The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it?",3,male
2789,LOKI, Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me?,3,male
2790,LOKI, Tell me!,3,male
2791,LOKI," All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard.",3,male
2792,LOKI," You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen.",3,male
2793,LOKI," It was cruel to put the hammer within your reach, knowing you could never lift it. Thor stares ahead, falling deeper into the abyss.",3,male
2794,LOKI, The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.,3,male
2795,LOKI," This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry.",3,male
2796,LOKI," Fare well, brother.",3,male
2797,LOKI," Hello, Father.",3,male
2798,LOKI," And I will make you proud. Loki savors the moment, but it's short- lived, as Thor bursts in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.",3,male
2799,LOKI, You can't stop it. The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.,3,male
2800,LOKI, Fight me.,3,male
2801,LOKI, What happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don't tell me it was a woman.,3,male
2802,LOKI, It was. Perhaps when we're finished here I'll pay her a little visit myself.,3,male
2803,LOKI, Please...,3,male
2804,LOKI," He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet, VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea. He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice. Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.",3,male
2805,LOKI," Stop! What are you doing?! Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM! The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream out from it. Loki thinks fast.",3,male
2806,LOKI," If you destroy the Bridge, you'll never see her again! Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor through the back.",3,male
2807,FANDRAL," Thank you, love.",3,male
2808,FANDRAL, Noooo!,3,male
2809,FANDRAL," My, we are hungry, aren't we? The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.",3,male
2810,FANDRAL," Name it, Lady Sif.",3,male
2811,FANDRAL," Well, if he doesn't show up soon, he shouldn't bother. Odin looks like he's ready to feed him to his ravens.",3,male
2812,FANDRAL, I've never been inside the Vault before. It's said the Tesseract was once held here.,3,male
2813,FANDRAL," We thought that was just you being your normal cheery self. Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.",3,male
2814,FANDRAL, What?!,3,male
2815,FANDRAL," This isn't like a journey to Earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god. This is Jotunheim.",3,male
2816,FANDRAL, You did.,3,male
2817,FANDRAL, And I.,3,male
2818,FANDRAL, And he can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim.,3,male
2819,FANDRAL," Please. Getting past him should be simple enough now, since he seems to be letting Frost Giants sneak by under his nose.",3,male
2820,FANDRAL," That was just a bit of a jest, really...",3,male
2821,FANDRAL, You bathe?,3,male
2822,FANDRAL," Actually, it's not. We could turn right around, hop back to Asgard, share a mug by the fire. Could be nice.",3,male
2823,FANDRAL, Adventuring? Is that what we're doing?,3,male
2824,FANDRAL, Freezing.,3,male
2825,FANDRAL," If I have to listen to Volstagg's singing voice one more time, I'll fall on my own sword!",3,male
2826,FANDRAL," I'm hoping that's just decorative. Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost Giant. His comrades form another circle around him, separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying this.",3,male
2827,FANDRAL," Well? What move, do you think?",3,male
2828,FANDRAL," At this close range? I think ""The Alfheim Lunge""¬ù is a better move.",3,male
2829,FANDRAL, You really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel? Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade away.,3,male
2830,FANDRAL," I may need a bit of help. Not a good look, is it?",3,male
2831,FANDRAL, How's the face?,3,male
2832,FANDRAL," At least he's only banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.",3,male
2833,FANDRAL, What?,3,male
2834,FANDRAL," Why is it every time you choose to speak, it has to be something dark and ominous?",3,male
2835,FANDRAL," Loki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely.",3,male
2836,FANDRAL," And tell him what? ""Oh, by the way, we think your son just betrayed the throne. And do us a favor. Bring back Thor. There's a good fellow!""¬ù",3,male
2837,FANDRAL, Where is Odin?,3,male
2838,FANDRAL, Of course.,3,male
2839,FANDRAL," Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne, Asgard on the brink of war, yet you manage to consume four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef, and two casks of ale. Shame on you! Don't you care?! Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg pulls his weapon, stopping him.",3,male
2840,FANDRAL," It's treason, Hogun.",3,male
2841,FANDRAL," Yes, yes, we know!",3,male
2842,FANDRAL," Complicated fellow, isn't he?",3,male
2843,FANDRAL, The winds would have blown them away by now. We should look for signs of a campfire.,3,male
2844,FANDRAL," It's worth a look, I suppose. The party tromps towards the town.",3,male
2845,FANDRAL, We're here to take you home. Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.,3,male
2846,FANDRAL," Or one of us, trying to protect you.",3,male
2847,FANDRAL," What do you think? ""The Svartalfheim Twist?""¬ù ""Kiss of the Hag?""¬ù ""Face Full of Boot?""¬ù Volstagg grins eagerly.",3,male
2848,FANDRAL," Not ""The Flying Mountain!""¬ù It threw out my back for a year last time!",3,male
2849,FANDRAL, Come on!,3,male
2850,FANDRAL, No. We can still fight!,3,male
2851,FANDRAL," Then I suppose we'd best start settling into our new lives. He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.",3,male
2852,FANDRAL," Sorry, my love. These things happen.",3,male
2853,FANDRAL, Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a--,3,male
2854,FANDRAL," Well, I was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield. That makes me the real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun? Hogun points to Volstagg.",3,male
2855,FANDRAL," Well, how about that? A smile! I'd say that calls for another drink!",3,male
2856,SIF, I'll miss you.,3,female
2857,SIF," Fandral, is it true the famous Warriors Three are ready to meet any challenge?",3,female
2858,SIF, Keep your mouth shut.,3,female
2859,SIF, He wants to make an entrance.,3,female
2860,SIF," Oh, please.",3,female
2861,SIF, The Destroyer.,3,female
2862,SIF, Shush!,3,female
2863,SIF," Redecorating, are we? Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.",3,female
2864,SIF," Thor, of all the laws of Asgard, this is one you must not break. Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings.",3,female
2865,SIF," It is forbidden! Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction.",3,female
2866,SIF, I did.,3,female
2867,SIF, I fear we'll live to regret this.,3,female
2868,SIF, He's just got to swing his hammer...,3,female
2869,SIF, Whining.,3,female
2870,SIF, Please don't make us sing again!,3,female
2871,SIF," Well, now I'm on board. She and Thor share a grin. The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a central plaza.",3,female
2872,SIF," If you don't treat me like a lady, I won't act like a lady! She takes out the Jotun. Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable, swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him. The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.",3,female
2873,SIF, I'm so glad I taught him how to do that!,3,female
2874,SIF," Of course you did. Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them out.",3,female
2875,SIF, There are too many of them!,3,female
2876,SIF, Thor!,3,female
2877,SIF, There was no stopping him.,3,female
2878,SIF," Loki, you're the only one who can help Thor now. You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind!",3,female
2879,SIF," He may speak about the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor.",3,female
2880,SIF, Who else could elude Heimdall's gaze with tricks of light and shadow?,3,female
2881,SIF, We should go to the Allfather.,3,female
2882,SIF," It's our duty. If any of our suspicions are right, then all of Asgard is in danger.",3,female
2883,SIF," Allfather, we must speak with you",3,female
2884,SIF, We would speak with her. Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices.,3,female
2885,SIF, We would ask you to end Thor's banishment.,3,female
2886,SIF," Stop it, both of you! We all know what we have to do, we're just too damned afraid to do it!",3,female
2887,SIF, Thor would do the same for us. An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.,3,female
2888,SIF," Yes, but--",3,female
2889,SIF, Look!,3,female
2890,SIF," Or we could just start there. She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.",3,female
2891,SIF, It has been a thousand years...,3,female
2892,SIF, Thor... your father still lives. Thor reacts to the revelation.,3,female
2893,SIF, The best thing you can do is get the mortals to safety and leave the battle to us.,3,female
2894,SIF, Keep him distracted. She hurries off. The Warriors Three continue towards the behemoth.,3,female
2895,SIF," Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and plunges it deep into the back of the creature. The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a brief moment of hope. But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation. Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180 degrees to face its attackers. The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor. Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks free, landing in the middle of the street.",3,female
2896,SIF, But the others...,3,female
2897,SIF, No! I will die a warrior's death. Stories will be told of this day-- He gently takes her shield from her.,3,female
2898,SIF, My Queen. I am so sorry for your loss.,3,female
2899,SIF, He mourns for his brother. And he misses her. The mortal.,3,female
2900,SIF," I will always be at his side. Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.",3,female
2901,VOLSTAGG, I hope this goes quickly. I'm famished.,3,male
2902,VOLSTAGG," Are you attached to that pretty face of yours? Because one more word, and you won't be.",3,male
2903,VOLSTAGG, Where is he?,3,male
2904,VOLSTAGG, What?,3,male
2905,VOLSTAGG," I thought it was but a legend. Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets the Casket back on its pedestal. It moves back to its post, the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it. Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.",3,male
2906,VOLSTAGG, The Tesseract? I thought that was but a legend too!,3,male
2907,VOLSTAGG, What's this -- ?!,3,male
2908,VOLSTAGG," All this food -- so innocent, cast to the ground. It breaks the heart!",3,male
2909,VOLSTAGG, Madness? What sort of madness?,3,male
2910,VOLSTAGG," And if the Frost Giants don't kill you, your Father will!",3,male
2911,VOLSTAGG, And I.,3,male
2912,VOLSTAGG, If we're lucky.,3,male
2913,VOLSTAGG, That will be no easy task. It's said the Gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away.,3,male
2914,VOLSTAGG, Jest not! He heareth all!,3,male
2915,VOLSTAGG, Forgive him! He meaneth no offense!,3,male
2916,VOLSTAGG, What happened? Your silver tongue turn to lead?,3,male
2917,VOLSTAGG, Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?,3,male
2918,VOLSTAGG," Ah. Never mind, then. Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others, grins.",3,male
2919,VOLSTAGG, This belt! This belt is now my lucky belt! I will never remove it! Even when bathing!,3,male
2920,VOLSTAGG," I'm liking that. Gauging, surveying. Particularly the distance part.",3,male
2921,VOLSTAGG, Starving.,3,male
2922,VOLSTAGG, Silly hammer! Has a mind of its own!,3,male
2923,VOLSTAGG," I say we use ""The Norn's Revenge.""¬ù",3,male
2924,VOLSTAGG," Maybe if they were three feet tall! No! How about ""The Randy Valkyrie""¬ù?",3,male
2925,VOLSTAGG, You may want to put some ice on that!,3,male
2926,VOLSTAGG, Hang on!,3,male
2927,VOLSTAGG, Right. Sorry.,3,male
2928,VOLSTAGG, That's unfortunate. He hurries to his wounded comrade.,3,male
2929,VOLSTAGG, Just try not to bleed.,3,male
2930,VOLSTAGG, Flawless.,3,male
2931,VOLSTAGG," Yes, it could! Might be an early spring!",3,male
2932,VOLSTAGG, Run!,3,male
2933,VOLSTAGG, What's Thor done?,3,male
2934,VOLSTAGG," Actually, could you bring the mists back, please?",3,male
2935,VOLSTAGG, We should never have let him go.,3,male
2936,VOLSTAGG, How did the guard even know? Loki stares at his arm.,3,male
2937,VOLSTAGG, You told the guard?,3,male
2938,VOLSTAGG," True, but we should be grateful to him. He did save our lives.",3,male
2939,VOLSTAGG, No! Surely not!,3,male
2940,VOLSTAGG, The ceremony was interrupted just before Thor was named King.,3,male
2941,VOLSTAGG, What is this?,3,male
2942,VOLSTAGG, Do not mistake my appetite for apathy.,3,male
2943,VOLSTAGG," To hell with treason, it's suicide.",3,male
2944,VOLSTAGG, We're doomed.,3,male
2945,VOLSTAGG," Good Heimdall, less us explain--",3,male
2946,VOLSTAGG, So you'll help us?,3,male
2947,VOLSTAGG," Now what do we do? Sif glances at the control panel, notices something.",3,male
2948,VOLSTAGG, He must have landed nearby. It's time to put our tracking skills to work. Spread out. Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints.,3,male
2949,VOLSTAGG," There you go, lad! The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head off.",3,male
2950,VOLSTAGG," Things change so fast here. You leave for a millennium, and it's like the whole neighborhood's gone. Volstagg sniffs, smells something.",3,male
2951,VOLSTAGG," Never cared for spies. He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a bite. He likes what he tastes.",3,male
2952,VOLSTAGG," Lady Sif and the Warriors Three. Surely you've heard tales of Hogun the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and I, Volstagg the Svelte? Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut.",3,male
2953,VOLSTAGG," Exactly! Those lovely herring people. They worshipped us! Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder.",3,male
2954,VOLSTAGG, You're but a mortal now. You'll get yourself killed!,3,male
2955,VOLSTAGG," ""The Flying Mountain.""¬ù Hogun and Fandral groan.",3,male
2956,VOLSTAGG," Trust me, it'll work.",3,male
2957,VOLSTAGG, For Asgaaaaard!!!,3,male
2958,VOLSTAGG," Your language? Ha! Silly girl, you're speaking ours. Thor calls up to the sky.",3,male
2959,VOLSTAGG, Then we're trapped here forever.,3,male
2960,VOLSTAGG," Primitive. Good enough for hunting small game, I suppose. Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy.",3,male
2961,VOLSTAGG," ...and then, with a mighty bellow, I flew at the great metal beast and laid it low...",3,male
2962,VOLSTAGG," As a matter of fact, falling down was a tactic. Lulling the Destroyer into a false sense of security!",3,male
2963,HOGUN, I told you they'd cancel it.,3,male
2964,HOGUN, And I. The Warriors Three fight together.,3,male
2965,HOGUN, We shouldn't be here.,3,male
2966,HOGUN," No, not that!",3,male
2967,HOGUN, Shut up!,3,male
2968,HOGUN, Watch the legs!,3,male
2969,HOGUN, Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin. The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.,3,male
2970,HOGUN," A master of magic could easily bring three Jotuns into Asgard. The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.",3,male
2971,HOGUN," We must go. We must find Thor. Hogun starts to pull the delicate HEALING STONES from the fire, carefully putting them into a POUCH at his side.",3,male
2972,HOGUN, Big stomach. Big mouth.,3,male
2973,HEIMDALL," You're not dressed warmly enough. Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.",3,male
2974,HEIMDALL," The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It will kill you all in time, even Thor.",3,male
2975,HEIMDALL, Or can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim?,3,male
2976,HEIMDALL," For ages have I guarded Asgard and kept it safe from those who would do it harm. In all that time, never has an enemy slipped by my watch -- until this day. I wish to know how that happened.",3,male
2977,HEIMDALL," Be warned. I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you. You'll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim.",3,male
2978,HEIMDALL, None do.,3,male
2979,HEIMDALL, All is ready. You may pass.,3,male
2980,HEIMDALL, To keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.,3,male
2981,HEIMDALL," I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see nor hear you. You were shrouded from me, like the Frost Giants who entered this Realm.",3,male
2982,HEIMDALL, Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see.,3,male
2983,HEIMDALL, No.,3,male
2984,HEIMDALL," Because he is my King, and I am sworn to obey him.",3,male
2985,HEIMDALL, Yes.,3,male
2986,HEIMDALL," You would defy the commands of Loki our King, break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back? The four exchange nervous glances.",3,male
2987,HEIMDALL, Good.,3,male
2988,HEIMDALL, I am bound by honor to our King. I cannot open the Bifrost to you.,3,male
2989,HEIMDALL," Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?",3,male
2990,HEIMDALL," Then I need no longer obey you. Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki. Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --",3,male
2991,HEIMDALL, Yes.,3,male
2992,LAUFEY," I am Laufey, King of this Realm.",3,male
2993,LAUFEY," We know who you are, Odinson. Why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world?",3,male
2994,LAUFEY," You ""demand?""¬ù",3,male
2995,LAUFEY, The house of Odin is full of traitors.,3,male
2996,LAUFEY," Your father is a murderer and a thief. He stole what was ours, and left our world in ruins. We have the right to reclaim the Casket.",3,male
2997,LAUFEY," And why have you come here? To make peace? You long for battle. You crave it. I see you for what you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man.",3,male
2998,LAUFEY, You should listen to his counsel. You know not what your actions would unleash.,3,male
2999,LAUFEY, Your boy sought this out.,3,male
3000,LAUFEY," We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather. He'll get what he came for -- war and death. Odin looks grim, determined.",3,male
3001,LAUFEY, Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.,3,male
3002,LAUFEY, To what end?,3,male
3003,LAUFEY, So you're the one who let us into Asgard.,3,male
3004,LAUFEY," My men are dead, and I have no Casket. You are a deceiver. Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki calmly stands his ground.",3,male
3005,LAUFEY," Ah, the bastard son. I thought Odin had killed you. That's what I would have done. He's as weak as you are.",3,male
3006,LAUFEY, Or perhaps it was the wisest choice I've ever made. I will hear you.,3,male
3007,LAUFEY, Why would you do this?,3,male
3008,LAUFEY, This is a great day for Jotunheim. Asgard is finally ours.,3,male
3009,LAUFEY, I accept.,3,male
3010,LAUFEY," It's said you can still see and hear what transpires around you, even in this state. I hope it's true, so that you may know your death came by the hand of Laufey. He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --",3,male
3011,COULSON," Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with",3,male
3012,COULSON, We're here investigating a security threat. We need to appropriate your equipment and all your atmospheric data.,3,male
3013,COULSON, This should more than compensate you for your trouble. She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.,3,male
3014,COULSON, Then I'm sure you can do it again.,3,male
3015,COULSON," We're the good guys, Ms. Foster. He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path. She is fully herself, fueled by outrage.",3,male
3016,COULSON, Thank you for your cooperation. He gets into a car. The cars and trucks pull away.,3,male
3017,COULSON, I want eyes up high. With a gun. Now!,3,male
3018,COULSON, Barton. Talk to me.,3,male
3019,COULSON, Barton...,3,male
3020,COULSON," Ground units, move in. Show's over.",3,male
3021,COULSON, It's not easy to do what you did. You made us all look like a bunch of mall cops. That's hurtful.,3,male
3022,COULSON," Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan? Then again, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type. What was it, South Africa? Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him.",3,male
3023,COULSON," One way or another, we find out what we want to know. We're good at that.",3,male
3024,COULSON, Good-bye? I just got back. Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone.,3,male
3025,COULSON," ""Donald Blake?""¬ù",3,male
3026,COULSON," You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. Selvig.",3,male
3027,COULSON, Uh-huh. You mind if we take a moment to verify his identity?,3,male
3028,COULSON, That doesn't explain how he managed to tear through our security. Selvig shrugs.,3,male
3029,COULSON, It says here he's an M.D.,3,male
3030,COULSON, Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig here.,3,male
3031,COULSON, Just keep him away from the bars.,3,male
3032,COULSON, Follow them.,3,male
3033,COULSON, What the hell was that?,3,male
3034,COULSON, Let's go take a look.,3,male
3035,COULSON, Get somebody from Linguistics out here.,3,male
3036,COULSON, I don't think so. But the guy doesn't tell me anything.,3,male
3037,COULSON, Donald... I don't think you've been completely honest with me.,3,male
3038,COULSON, Not stolen. Borrowed. Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues.,3,male
3039,THOR," Now I know what you’re thinking. Oh no!  Thor’s in a cage.  How did this happen? Well, sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody. It’s a long story but basically I'm a bit of a hero. See, I spent some time on earth, fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times. Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things... didn’t find any. That’s when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage... where I met you.",5,male
3040,THOR," Surtur.  Son of a bitch...you’re still alive!  I thought my father killed you, like, half a million years ago.",5,male
3041,THOR," You know, it’s funny you should mention that because I’ve been having these terrible dreams of late.  Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and you Surtur are at the center of all of them.",5,male
3042,THOR," Oh, hang on.  Give it a second.",5,male
3043,THOR, The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?,5,male
3044,THOR," Okay, so where is it? This crown?",5,male
3045,THOR," Oh, that’s a crown? I thought it was a big eyebrow.",5,male
3046,THOR," Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head.",5,male
3047,THOR," That’s intense.  To be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.  But it looks like I’m going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains, knock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard’s vault.",5,male
3048,THOR, Because that’s what heroes do.,5,male
3049,THOR, I make grave mistakes all the time. Everything seems to work out.,5,male
3050,THOR," Heimdall, come on.",5,male
3051,THOR, Who are you?,5,male
3052,THOR, Right.  Where’s Heimdall?,5,male
3053,THOR, Traitor?,5,male
3054,THOR, Sure.,5,male
3055,THOR, What the hell is that?,5,male
3056,THOR, Father.,5,male
3057,THOR, It’s an interesting play.  What’s it called?,5,male
3058,THOR," Indeed they should. I like that statue.  A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though.  A little less weasely.  Less greasy maybe.",5,male
3059,THOR, Do me a favor.  Lock this in a vault so it doesn’t turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet.,5,male
3060,THOR, Nope.  I’ve been having this reocurring dream lately.,5,male
3061,THOR," Possibly... but then I decide to go out there and investigate.  And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.  Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise, all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms, are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes.",5,male
3062,THOR," Of course, the freedom to be massacred.",5,male
3063,THOR, Watching theatre.,5,male
3064,THOR, You really going to make me do it?,5,male
3065,THOR, You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.,5,male
3066,THOR, Then I’ll see you on the other side...brother.,5,male
3067,THOR, Where’s Odin?,5,male
3068,THOR, Where’s father?  Did you kill him?,5,male
3069,THOR," Right here on the sidewalk?  Or right there, where the building that’s being demolished?  Great planning.",5,male
3070,THOR, Then why do you dress like one?,5,male
3071,THOR," I can’t believe you’re alive. I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you.",5,male
3072,THOR, Sure. Start figuring out where he is.,5,male
3073,THOR," She didn’t dump me, you know.  I dumped her.  It was a mutual dumping.",5,male
3074,THOR, Loki?,5,male
3075,THOR, So earth has wizards now?,5,male
3076,THOR," Alright wizard, who are you?  Why should I care?",5,male
3077,THOR, I don’t drink tea.,5,male
3078,THOR, Not tea.,5,male
3079,THOR, He’s a worthy inclusion.,5,male
3080,THOR, We’re looking for my father.,5,male
3081,THOR, Promptly.,5,male
3082,THOR," If you knew where he was, why didn’t you call me?",5,male
3083,THOR," No, I don’t have a phone, but you could have sent an electronic letter.  It’s called an email.",5,male
3084,THOR," No. What for? Anyway, my father is no longer in exile. So if you could tell me where he is, I can take him home.",5,male
3085,THOR, Will you stop doing that?,5,male
3086,THOR," Let me explain something, my hair is not to be meddled wi-!",5,male
3087,THOR, We could have just walked.,5,male
3088,THOR, All right.,5,male
3089,THOR, Yes.,5,male
3090,THOR, Yeah of course. Thank you very much for your help.,5,male
3091,THOR, Loki.,5,male
3092,THOR, Father?,5,male
3093,THOR," Father, it’s us.",5,male
3094,THOR, I know.  We’ve come to take you home.,5,male
3095,THOR," Loki, lift your magic.",5,male
3096,THOR," I know that we failed you, but we can make this right.",5,male
3097,THOR," No, I’ve stopped Ragnarok.  I put an end to Surtur.",5,male
3098,THOR," Father, who are you talking about?",5,male
3099,THOR, ...what?,5,male
3100,THOR," Whatever she is, we can stop her. We can face her together.",5,male
3101,THOR, This was your doing.,5,male
3102,THOR," You must be Hela.  I’m Thor, son of Odin.",5,male
3103,THOR, I don’t think so.,5,male
3104,THOR, No!!,5,male
3105,THOR, Loki!,5,male
3106,THOR, I’m just passing through.,5,male
3107,THOR, Thank you.,5,male
3108,THOR, Hey!  Where are you taking me?,5,male
3109,THOR, What...the hell?,5,male
3110,THOR, A what?,5,male
3111,THOR, Just wait a damn minute.  I’m not for sale.,5,male
3112,THOR, You’ll pay for this!,5,male
3113,THOR, I am the God of THUNDER!!!,5,male
3114,THOR, Hi.,5,male
3115,THOR," Oh, my god!",5,male
3116,THOR," Oh, the smell.",5,male
3117,THOR," We’re not friends, and I don’t give a shit about your games! I’m going back to Asgard!",5,male
3118,THOR, Loki!? Loki! Over here!,5,male
3119,THOR, Loki!,5,male
3120,THOR," Yes, of course I’m alive.",5,male
3121,THOR," What do you mean, what am I doing? I’m stuck in this stupid chair. Where’s your chair?",5,male
3122,THOR, Get me out of this one.,5,male
3123,THOR, What?,5,male
3124,THOR," Oh, he’s crazy!",5,male
3125,THOR, Weeks ago?  I just got here.,5,male
3126,THOR, God of Thunder.  Tell him.,5,male
3127,THOR, He’s my brother.,5,male
3128,THOR, You take this thing out of my neck and I’ll show you.,5,male
3129,THOR, Asgard.,5,male
3130,THOR, Fine.  Then point me in the direction of whoever’s ass I have to kick.,5,male
3131,THOR, Loki!,5,male
3132,THOR," You’re a Kronan, aren’t you?",5,male
3133,THOR, How’d you end up in here?,5,male
3134,THOR, How did you...,5,male
3135,THOR, This doesn’t make any sense.,5,male
3136,THOR, Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster’s Champion?,5,male
3137,THOR, What about you? You’re made of rocks.,5,male
3138,THOR," Yes I am.  Fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place.",5,male
3139,THOR," Odin, I bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla... Where the brave shall live forever. Nor shall we mourn but rejoice-",5,male
3140,THOR," What would you like me to say?  You faked your own death, you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power, stranded him on Earth... -to die, releasing the Goddess of Death.",5,male
3141,THOR, No.,5,male
3142,THOR, I really wish I had my hammer.,5,male
3143,THOR," Quite unique.  It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star.  And when I spun it really, really fast it gave me the ability to fly.",5,male
3144,THOR," No, I didn’t ride the hammer.",5,male
3145,THOR," No. I used to spin it really fast, and it would pull me off the...",5,male
3146,THOR," The ground.  It would pull me off the ground, up into the air, and I would fly.  Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me.",5,male
3147,THOR, That’s a nice way of putting it.,5,male
3148,THOR," See her, the one that put me in here.",5,male
3149,THOR, Asgardian?,5,male
3150,THOR," Please, help me.  I need your help.",5,male
3151,THOR," Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward because the Valkyrie are sworn to protect the throne.",5,male
3152,THOR," By Odin’s beard, you shall not cut my hair... lest you feel the wrath of the might Thor.",5,male
3153,THOR, Yes!,5,male
3154,THOR," Hey!  We know each other. He’s a friend from work. Where have you been?  Everybody thought you were dead.  So much has happened since I last saw you.  I lost my hammer.  Like, yesterday, so that’s still pretty fresh. Loki!  Loki’s alive.  Can you believe it?  He’s up there. Loki!  Look who it is!",5,male
3155,THOR, What are you doing?  It’s me.,5,male
3156,THOR," Hey, big guy. The sun’s getting real low.",5,male
3157,THOR, All right. Screw it.,5,male
3158,THOR, Are we cool?,5,male
3159,THOR," Like this.  Big, green, ...stupid.",5,male
3160,THOR, How’d you get here?,5,male
3161,THOR, You mean cheating?,5,male
3162,THOR, Yes.  Where is the Quinjet now?,5,male
3163,THOR," Yes!  I’m getting us out of here. This is a terrible, awful place. You’re gonna love Asgard.  It’s big.  It’s golden.  Shiny.",5,male
3164,THOR," No, no, no.  My people need me to get back to Asgard.  We must prevent Ragnarok.",5,male
3165,THOR," The prophesied death of my home world, the end of days, it’s the end of- If you help me get back to Asgard, I can help you get back to Earth.",5,male
3166,THOR," Earth loves Hulk.  They love you. You’re of the Avengers.  One of the team, one of our friends.  This is what friends do. They support each other.",5,male
3167,THOR, I’m not Banner’s friend. I prefer you.,5,male
3168,THOR, I don’t even like Banner. “I’m into numbers and science and stuff.”,5,male
3169,THOR," Fine.  Stay here.  Stupid place. It’s hideous, by the way.  The red, the white.  Just pick a color.",5,male
3170,THOR, You didn’t smash anything. I won that fight,5,male
3171,THOR," Yeah, sure, sure.",5,male
3172,THOR, What?,5,male
3173,THOR, Moron!  You big child.,5,male
3174,THOR, I am going.,5,male
3175,THOR, That’s great. Have fun.,5,male
3176,THOR, What’s going on here?,5,male
3177,THOR, You’re talking about evacuating Asgard?,5,male
3178,THOR," I’m working on it, but I don’t even really know where the hell I am.",5,male
3179,THOR, Which one?,5,male
3180,THOR, Shut up.,5,male
3181,THOR," I’m not sad, you idiot.  I’m pissed off!  Angry.  I lost my father.  I lost my hammer.",5,male
3182,THOR, You’re not even listening.,5,male
3183,THOR, You’re being a really bad friend.,5,male
3184,THOR, You know what we call you?,5,male
3185,THOR, We call you the stupid Avenger.,5,male
3186,THOR," What, are you crazy?",5,male
3187,THOR, You know what? Earth does hate you.,5,male
3188,THOR, I’m sorry I said those things. You’re not the stupid Avenger. Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.,5,male
3189,THOR, You just can’t go around throwing shields at people.  Could have killed me.,5,male
3190,THOR," I know. We’re the same, you and I. We’re just a couple of hot-headed fools.",5,male
3191,THOR, We’re kind of both like fire.,5,male
3192,THOR," Hulk, I need you to do something for me.",5,male
3193,THOR, We need to talk.,5,male
3194,THOR, I need her to stay.,5,male
3195,THOR, Asgard is in danger and people are dying. We need to get back there. I need your help...wow.,5,male
3196,THOR, Odin is dead.,5,male
3197,THOR, I’m going to stop her.,5,male
3198,THOR," Nope. I’m putting together a team. It’s me, you, and the big guy.",5,male
3199,THOR, It’s me and you.,5,male
3200,THOR," Wait.  Just listen.  The Valkyrie are legend, elite warriors of Asgard.  You are sworn to defend the throne.",5,male
3201,THOR, What’s that supposed to mean?,5,male
3202,THOR, I agree.,5,male
3203,THOR," I agree.  That’s why I turned down the throne.  But this isn’t about the crown.  This is about the people.  They’re dying and they’re you’re people, too.",5,male
3204,THOR, Okay.,5,male
3205,THOR, Good. Great.,5,male
3206,THOR, Thank you.,5,male
3207,THOR, For this.,5,male
3208,THOR, All right.  Come on.,5,male
3209,THOR, Thor.,5,male
3210,THOR," Thor, son of Odin.",5,male
3211,THOR, God of Thunder.,5,male
3212,THOR, Strongest Avenger.,5,male
3213,THOR, Strongest Avenger!,5,male
3214,THOR," Damn you, Stark. Point Break.",5,male
3215,THOR," No, no, no!",5,male
3216,THOR, Stop! Stop breaking everything!,5,male
3217,THOR," Banner. Hey, hey, hey. You all right, Banner?  Sun’s going down. Sun’s going down.  That’s it, breathe. I won’t hurt you. Sun’s going down.",5,male
3218,THOR, Yeah.,5,male
3219,THOR, Some creepy old man cut it off.,5,male
3220,THOR, Thanks.,5,male
3221,THOR," Nat is good, I’m sure.",5,male
3222,THOR, Sokovia?,5,male
3223,THOR," Banner, listen.",5,male
3224,THOR, Sokovia.  Ultron.  That was two years ago.,5,male
3225,THOR, I’m afraid so.,5,male
3226,THOR," Banner, there’s something you should know...",5,male
3227,THOR, What?,5,male
3228,THOR," Yeah, about that.",5,male
3229,THOR, He kind of runs the place. You actually lived in his house.,5,male
3230,THOR, Yeah. Quite a lot’s happened. You and I had a fight recently.,5,male
3231,THOR," No, I won. Easily.",5,male
3232,THOR," Well, it’s true.",5,male
3233,THOR, Seductive GOD of Thunder.  We need to move.,5,male
3234,THOR," No, no, no.  Don’t freak out. You’re okay.  Put these on.",5,male
3235,THOR," I know, come on.",5,male
3236,THOR," No, he’s not here.  But listen. Just stay calm, okay?  The sun’s going down.  The sun’s getting really low.  Sun’s going down.",5,male
3237,THOR, The sun’s going down. It’s getting really low.  The sun’s going down. It’s getting real low.,5,male
3238,THOR, I just need you to stay calm.,5,male
3239,THOR, It’s just a planet.  You’ve been on a planet before.,5,male
3240,THOR, Now you’ve been on two. That’s a good thing.  It’s a new experience.,5,male
3241,THOR," Alright, well, you’re back now, that’s all that matters.",5,male
3242,THOR," We’re not stranded, I’m gonna figure out a way to get us home.",5,male
3243,THOR," Not your home, though.  Asgard.",5,male
3244,THOR," Listen, my people are in great danger.  You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being who also happens to be my sister.",5,male
3245,THOR," No, she’s an evil being.",5,male
3246,THOR," No, no.  I’m putting together the team. The Hulk is the fire.",5,male
3247,THOR, What?  No!,5,male
3248,THOR," No!  I don’t even like the Hulk. He’s all like... “smash, smash, smash.”  I prefer you.",5,male
3249,THOR," But if I’m being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings, he is very powerful and useful.",5,male
3250,THOR, Is he though?,5,male
3251,THOR," Fine, you don’t have to fight anyone.  But we’re in danger here, so we have to move.",5,male
3252,THOR, I need a disguise.  I’m a fugitive.,5,male
3253,THOR, You are the disguise.,5,male
3254,THOR, What?,5,male
3255,THOR," No, no you’re not Tony.  You’re Bruce Banner.",5,male
3256,THOR, Because you were naked.,5,male
3257,THOR, What are you doing?  Stop doing that!,5,male
3258,THOR, Why are you being so weird?,5,male
3259,THOR," Hey.  It’s okay.  You’re good. Calm down.  Come on.  Listen, we’re gonna go to Asgard and you’re not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again. All right?",5,male
3260,THOR, This is bad.  Banner!  Banner!,5,male
3261,THOR, I was gonna do that.,5,male
3262,THOR, That’s good.  What are you doing here?,5,male
3263,THOR, I got sidetracked.,5,male
3264,THOR, It’s my disguise.,5,male
3265,THOR," Not when I do this, you can’t. Your hair looks nice. I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?",5,male
3266,THOR, He’s a friend.,5,male
3267,THOR," I was thinking that you drink too much, and that probably was going to kill you.",5,male
3268,THOR, Good.,5,male
3269,THOR," Yeah, it’s called the Revengers.",5,male
3270,THOR, Because I’m getting revenge. You’re getting revenge. Do you want revenge?,5,male
3271,THOR, Okay.,5,male
3272,THOR, Just had to be sure.,5,male
3273,THOR, Is that... a Dragonfang?,5,male
3274,THOR, My God.  This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.,5,male
3275,THOR, Nope. We’re going through that one.,5,male
3276,THOR," For the record, I didn’t know it was called that when I picked it.",5,male
3277,THOR, She’s right.  We need one that can withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity.,5,male
3278,THOR," What do you say, doctor?  Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway. Talk about an adventure.",5,male
3279,THOR, You’re telling us you can get us access into the garage without setting off any alarms?,5,male
3280,THOR," Yes, me too.  On many, many occasions.  There was one time when we were children, he transformed himself into a snake, and he knows that I love snakes.  So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it and he transformed back into himself and he was like, “Yeah, it’s me!” And he stabbed me.  We were eight at the time.",5,male
3281,THOR, Shut up.,5,male
3282,THOR," No, there’s no beast. He’s just being stupid.  We’re going to start a revolution.",5,male
3283,THOR, I’ll explain later.,5,male
3284,THOR, I’ll explain later.,5,male
3285,THOR," Hey, so listen, we should talk.",5,male
3286,THOR, You have no idea.  I’ve had quite the revelation since we spoke last.,5,male
3287,THOR, Thought you didn’t want to talk about it?,5,male
3288,THOR, That’s exactly what I was thinking.,5,male
3289,THOR," This place is perfect for you. It’s savage, chaotic, lawless. Brother, you’re going to do GREAT here.",5,male
3290,THOR," Loki, I thought the world of you. I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever. But, at the end of",5,male
3291,THOR, That’s what you always wanted.,5,male
3292,THOR, “Get Help.”,5,male
3293,THOR," Come on, you love it.",5,male
3294,THOR, It’s great. IT works every time.,5,male
3295,THOR, Do you have a better plan?,5,male
3296,THOR, We’re doing it.,5,male
3297,THOR," Get help! Please! My brother, he’s dying.",5,male
3298,THOR," Not for me, it’s not.",5,male
3299,THOR," Never one for sentiment, were you?",5,male
3300,THOR, I agree.,5,male
3301,THOR," All right, I can figure this out. It’s just another spaceship.",5,male
3302,THOR," Yes, we should. Where are the guns on this ship?",5,male
3303,THOR, Yeah. Don’t touch anything.,5,male
3304,THOR, No!,5,male
3305,THOR, Get inside!,5,male
3306,THOR, I should probably go and help.,5,male
3307,THOR, You’re a scientist.  Use one of your PhDs.,5,male
3308,THOR," Okay, drop me off at the palace and I’ll draw her away.",5,male
3309,THOR," The people trapped down there are all that matters.  While I’m dealing with Hela, I need you two to help get everyone off Asgard.",5,male
3310,THOR, I have a man on the ground.,5,male
3311,THOR, Now the ship has guns.,5,male
3312,THOR, I found this in the armory.,5,male
3313,THOR, Sister.,5,male
3314,THOR," I love what you’ve done with the place.  Redecorating, I see.",5,male
3315,THOR, Or to cast it out. He told you you were worthy.  He said the same thing to me.,5,male
3316,THOR," I understand why you’re angry. And you are my sister, and technically have a claim to the throne. And believe me, I would love for someone else to rule. But it can’t be you.  You’re just...the worst.",5,male
3317,THOR," You know, Father once told me that a wise king never seeks out war.",5,male
3318,THOR, She’s too strong.  Without my hammer I cannot--,5,male
3319,THOR, It’s too late. She’s already taken Asgard.,5,male
3320,THOR, I’m not as strong as you.,5,male
3321,THOR, You’re late.,5,male
3322,THOR, I think we should disband the Revengers.,5,male
3323,THOR, I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning.  It did nothing.,5,male
3324,THOR, It won’t end there.  The longer Hela’s on Asgard the more powerful she grows.  She’ll hunt us down. We need to stop her here and now.,5,male
3325,THOR," Asgard’s not a place, it’s a people. This was never about stopping Ragnarok...it was about causing Ragnarok. Go to the vault.  Surtur’s crown. It’s the only way.",5,male
3326,THOR, Shall we?,5,male
3327,THOR, GO!  GO NOW!,5,male
3328,THOR," No, but he can.",5,male
3329,THOR, We’re fulfilling the prophecy.,5,male
3330,THOR," So do I, but we have no choice.",5,male
3331,THOR, We need to let him finish... No!,5,male
3332,THOR, What have I done?,5,male
3333,THOR," Perhaps you’re not so bad after all, brother.",5,male
3334,THOR," Thank you, Loki.",5,male
3335,THOR," I’m not sure.  Any suggestions? Miek, what’s your home planet?",5,male
3336,THOR, Earth it is.,5,male
3337,THOR, Sure!  They love me there.,5,male
3338,THOR," Probably not.  But don’t worry, brother...I’ve got a feeling that everything’s going to work out.",5,male
3339,THOR, How much longer do you think we’ll be here?,5,male
3340,THOR, I’ll be back around shortly.  I really feel like we were connecting there.,5,male
3341,THOR," Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it.",5,male
3342,THOR," I swear I’m not even moving, it’s just doing this on its own.  I’m really sorry. Okay, let me get this straight. You’re going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame, and then you’ll suddenly grow as big as a house--",5,male
3343,THOR," Wait, sorry.  I didn’t time that right. And, now!",5,male
3344,THOR," Heimdall. I know it’s been a while, but I could use a fast exit!",5,male
3345,THOR, ...Heimdall?,5,male
3346,THOR, Stay. I’m running short on--,5,male
3347,THOR, -options.,5,male
3348,THOR, You know what this is?,5,male
3349,THOR, Not even your face.,5,male
3350,THOR," What’s this, what are you doing!?",5,male
3351,THOR, Sorry,5,male
3352,THOR, I suppose I’ll need my brother back.,5,male
3353,THOR, It’s not possible.,5,male
3354,THOR," Answer me! Hey! I am Thor, son of Odin.  I need to get back to Asgard.",5,male
3355,THOR, Hey!  Hey!,5,male
3356,THOR, Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk.  Asgard is in danger.,5,male
3357,THOR," Please.  Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair!  No!",5,male
3358,THOR," Banner, I never thought I would say this, but I’m happy to see you.",5,male
3359,THOR," Banner.  Hey, Banner!",5,male
3360,THOR," Banner, we’re friends.  This is crazy.  I don’t want to hurt you!",5,male
3361,THOR, That’s it.  The sun’s going down. I won’t hurt you anymore.  No one will.,5,male
3362,THOR," I know you’re in there, Banner. I’ll get you out!",5,male
3363,THOR, What’s the matter with you? You’re embarrassing me! I told them we were friends!,5,male
3364,THOR, It’s Hulk in a hot tub. How long have you been like that?,5,male
3365,THOR, That’s naked.  He’s very naked. It’s in my brain now.,5,male
3366,THOR," Heimdall, I know you can see me.",5,male
3367,THOR, I need you to help me.  Help me see.,5,male
3368,THOR," Hela, the Goddess of Death has invaded Asgard.",5,male
3369,THOR, Didn’t see that did you?,5,male
3370,THOR," There... that’s better.  You know, go ahead. Stay here and get drunk and enslave people for that lunatic. Keep drinking. Keep hiding. But me...",5,male
3371,THOR, I choose to run toward my problems and not away from them. Because that’s what...,5,male
3372,THOR, Because that’s what heroes do.,5,male
3373,THOR, Hi.,5,male
3374,THOR, Hello!,5,male
3375,THOR," Hey, let’s do “Get Help.”",5,male
3376,THOR, Get help! Help him!,5,male
3377,THOR, Classic.,5,male
3378,THOR, Which one’s the ship she told us to get?,5,male
3379,THOR," Oh brother, you’re becoming predictable.  I trust you, you betray me.  Round and round in circles we go.",5,male
3380,THOR," See, Loki, life is about, it’s about growth.  It’s about change. But you seem to just wanna stay the same. I guess what I’m trying to say is that you’ll always be the God of Mischief, but you could be more.  I’ll just put this over here for you.",5,male
3381,THOR," Anyway, I got places to be so good luck.",5,male
3382,THOR," Here, take the wheel.",5,male
3383,THOR, You want Asgard?  It’s yours.,5,male
3384,THOR, Hulk no!  Stop it you moron!!,5,male
3385,THOR," Hulk, just for once in your life, don’t smash!",5,male
3386,THOR," And if you were here, I might even give you a hug.",5,male
3387,SURTUR, I cannot die. Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home.,5,male
3388,SURTUR," Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard. The great prophecy--",5,male
3389,SURTUR," My time has come. When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame, I shall be restored to my full might. I will tower over the mountains and bury my sword deep in Asgard’s--",5,male
3390,SURTUR, A mountain!,5,male
3391,SURTUR, Odin is not on Asgard. And your absence has left the throne defenseless.,5,male
3392,SURTUR," This is my Crown, the source of my power.",5,male
3393,SURTUR, It’s a crown.,5,male
3394,SURTUR," But Ragnarok has already begun. You cannot stop it.  I am Asgard’s doom, and so are you.  All will suffer, all will burn.",5,male
3395,SURTUR, You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight it?,5,male
3396,SURTUR," You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.",5,male
3397,SURTUR," Tremble before me Asgard, for I am your reckoning!",5,male
3398,SURTUR," Surtur destroys Asgard, he destroys Hela so that our people can live.",5,male
3399,SURTUR, I am Asgard’s doom!!,5,male
3400,SKURGE," Heimdall was an idiot.  This job should have made him rich.  Now, the job ain’t easy, but it does have its benefits. The Bi-Frost gives me access to everything the Nine Realms have to offer. I mean it’s all mine for the taking. Behold...my stuff.",5,male
3401,SKURGE, You girls are in for a treat.,5,male
3402,SKURGE," Girls! Well well, look who decided to pop in.  Thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains.",5,male
3403,SKURGE, Don’t you remember?  I’m Skurge. We fought together on Vanaheim.,5,male
3404,SKURGE," That traitor.  No one knows, he’s a fugitive of the throne.",5,male
3405,SKURGE," Yeah, you see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty, but he disappeared before the trial.  Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the Universe.",5,male
3406,SKURGE, Hold on.  I’m supposed to announce your arrival.,5,male
3407,SKURGE, Behold!  Thor..Odinson.,5,male
3408,SKURGE, I’m just a janitor.,5,male
3409,SKURGE, Odin’s treasures.,5,male
3410,SKURGE, The common folk aren’t exactly falling in line.  There’s a resistance trying to knock down the front gates.,5,male
3411,SKURGE," Well, me dad was a stonemason, me mum was-",5,male
3412,SKURGE, I just want a chance to prove myself.,5,male
3413,SKURGE," Asgardians, some misguided soul has stolen the Bifrost sword.  Tell us where it is, or there will be consequences.  Bad ones.",5,male
3414,SKURGE, Heimdall!  The sword!,5,male
3415,SKURGE, For Asgard.,5,male
3416,LOKI," Oh, brother.  This is it.  I take my leave.",5,male
3417,LOKI, I’m sorry.,5,male
3418,LOKI, Sorry for all I’ve done.,5,male
3419,LOKI, I’m sorry I tried to rule Earth.,5,male
3420,LOKI, I’m sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.  I just couldn’t help myself.,5,male
3421,LOKI, I’m a trickster.,5,male
3422,LOKI, Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.,5,male
3423,LOKI, Tell my story.,5,male
3424,LOKI, Build a statue for me.,5,male
3425,LOKI," With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns.",5,male
3426,LOKI, I didn’t do it for him.,5,male
3427,THOR," You fool, you didn’t listen!",5,male
3428,THOR, Lady Sif!  Get help!,5,male
3429,THOR, It’s all right.,5,male
3430,THOR, They’d be lucky to have you.,5,male
3431,THOR, I know.,5,male
3432,THOR, So mischievous.,5,male
3433,THOR, It was a wonderful joke.,5,male
3434,THOR, You are the savior of Asgard.,5,male
3435,THOR, I will.,5,male
3436,THOR, We will build a big statue for you.,5,male
3437,THOR, I will tell Father what you did here today.,5,male
3438,THOR, Noooooo!!!,5,male
3439,ODIN, Twas indeed hilarious.,5,male
3440,ODIN, Bravo!  Bravo!  Well done.  Bravo.,5,male
3441,ODIN," Oh, shit. My son!  Thor has returned! Greetings my boy.",5,male
3442,ODIN, The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The people wanted to commemorate him.,5,male
3443,ODIN," So it’s back to Midgard for you, is it?",5,male
3444,ODIN, That’s just a silly dream... Signs of an overactive imagination.,5,male
3445,ODIN," Well, it is best to respect our neighbors’ freedom.",5,male
3446,ODIN," Yes, besides, I have been rather busy myself.",5,male
3447,ODIN," Board meetings, and security council meetings...",5,male
3448,ODIN, Do what?,5,male
3449,ODIN, You’ve gone quite mad.  You’ll be executed for this!,5,male
3450,ODIN, Look at this place. It’s beautiful.,5,male
3451,ODIN, My sons.  I’ve been waiting for you.,5,male
3452,ODIN," Home, yes.  Your mother, she calls me.  Do you hear it?",5,male
3453,ODIN, Took me quite a while to break free from your spell.  Frigga would have been proud.,5,male
3454,ODIN, I failed you. It is upon us...Ragnarok.,5,male
3455,ODIN," No.  It has already begun.  She’s coming.  My life was all that held her back, but my time has come.  I cannot keep her away any longer.",5,male
3456,ODIN, The Goddess of Death.  Hela.  My first born. Your sister.,5,male
3457,ODIN," Her violent appetites grew beyond my control.  I couldn’t stop her, so I imprisoned her.  Locked her away.  She draws her strength from Asgard...and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless.",5,male
3458,ODIN, No we won’t.  I’m on a different path now.  This you must face alone.,5,male
3459,ODIN," Are you Thor, God of Hammers?",5,male
3460,ODIN, Asgard is not a place. Never has been. This could be Asgard.  It is wherever our people stand.  And right now those people need you.,5,male
3461,ODIN, No.  You’re stronger.,5,male
3462,LOKI," Alright, I yield!",5,male
3463,LOKI, You had one job!  Just the one.,5,male
3464,LOKI," You just couldn’t stay away, could you?  Everything was fine without you.  Asgard was prospering You’ve ruined everything.  Ask them.",5,male
3465,LOKI," You had what you wanted, you had the independence you asked for!",5,male
3466,LOKI," I swear, I left him right here.",5,male
3467,LOKI, How was I supposed to know? Can’t see into the future.  I’m not a witch.,5,male
3468,LOKI, Hey.,5,male
3469,LOKI, I’m honored.,5,male
3470,LOKI, This... isn’t me.,5,male
3471,LOKI, ...I have been falling...for thirty minutes!,5,male

3474,LOKI, Brother.,5,male
3475,LOKI, Perhaps we can reach an arrangement.,5,male
3476,LOKI, Beg your pardon?,5,male
3477,LOKI, Bring us back!,5,male
3478,LOKI," There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me.  At that moment, I let go.",5,male
3479,LOKI, Excuse me one second.,5,male
3480,LOKI, What?  You’re alive?,5,male
3481,LOKI, What are you doing here?,5,male
3482,LOKI, I didn’t get a chair.,5,male
3483,LOKI, I can’t.,5,male
3484,LOKI, I’ve made friends with this man. He’s called the Grandmaster.,5,male
3485,LOKI, I’ve gained his favor.. The Bi- Frost brought me out here weeks ago.,5,male
3486,LOKI, I’ve never met this man in my life.,5,male
3487,LOKI, Adopted.,5,male
3488,LOKI," You know, I haven’t seen this Beloved Champion he talks of, but I’ve heard he’s astonishingly savage.  I’ve placed a large wager against you tomorrow. Don’t let me down.",5,male
3489,LOKI, I have to get off this planet.,5,male
3490,LOKI, Yes! That’s how it feels! I’m just a huge fan of the sport.,5,male
3491,LOKI," Grandmaster, I-",5,male
3492,LOKI," My dear friend, if you were to give me twelve hours I could bring them both back to you.",5,male
3493,LOKI, I could do it in one.,5,male
3494,LOKI, What have you done!?,5,male
3495,LOKI, It’s Loki.  And you will answer to the Grandmaster.,5,male
3496,LOKI, You’re a Valkyrie.  I thought the Valkyrie all died gruesome deaths?,5,male
3497,LOKI, Terribly sorry.  Must be a very painful memory...,5,male
3498,LOKI, OW!,5,male
3499,LOKI," Hello, Bruce.",5,male
3500,LOKI, It varies from moment to moment.,5,male
3501,LOKI," I don’t mean to impose, but the Grandmaster has a great many ships. I may eve have stolen the access codes to his security system.",5,male
3502,LOKI," Heavens, no. I’ve run out of favor with the Grandmaster.",5,male
3503,LOKI," Yes, brother. I can.",5,male
3504,LOKI, Why not set the beast loose?,5,male
3505,LOKI, I disagree.  Open communication was never our family’s forte.,5,male
3506,LOKI, Hi!,5,male
3507,LOKI, Here’s the thing. I’m probably better off staying here on Sakaar.,5,male
3508,LOKI, ...Did you just agree with me?,5,male
3509,LOKI, Do you truly think so little of me?,5,male
3510,LOKI, It’s probably for the best that we never see one another again.,5,male
3511,LOKI, What?,5,male
3512,LOKI, No.,5,male
3513,LOKI, I hate it.,5,male
3514,LOKI, It’s humiliating.,5,male
3515,LOKI, No.,5,male
3516,LOKI, We are not doing “Get Help.”,5,male
3517,LOKI, I still hate it. It’s humiliating.,5,male
3518,LOKI, The Commodore.,5,male
3519,LOKI," I know I’ve betrayed you many times before, but this time it’s truly nothing personal.  The reward for your capture will set me up nicely.",5,male
3520,LOKI, Easier to let it burn.,5,male
3521,LOKI, Thank you.,5,male
3522,LOKI, You do seem like you’re in desperate need of leadership.,5,male
3523,LOKI, Your savior is here!,5,male
3524,LOKI," Did you miss me?  Everybody on that ship, now.",5,male
3525,LOKI, Of course you did.,5,male
3526,LOKI, You’re missing an eye.,5,male
3527,LOKI, Hit her with a lightning blast.,5,male

3529,LOKI," Bold move, brother. Even for me.",5,male
3530,LOKI, This is madness.,5,male
3531,LOKI," With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.",5,male
3532,LOKI, Maybe not.,5,male
3533,LOKI, Do we have to hug now?,5,male
3534,LOKI, Do you really think it’s a good idea to go back to Earth?,5,male
3535,LOKI, Let me rephrase: Do you really think it’s a good idea to bring me back to Earth?,5,male
3536,LOKI, Ow-ow-ow!  Alright!  I know exactly where he is.,5,male
3537,LOKI," It hurts, doesn’t it? Being lied to. Being told you’re one thing and then learning it’s all a fiction.",5,male
3538,LOKI," You didn’t think I’d really come and see you, did you?  This place is disgusting.",5,male
3539,LOKI, Does this mean you don’t want my help?,5,male
3540,LOKI," Look, I couldn’t jeopardize my position with Grandmaster, it took me time to win his trust. He’s a lunatic, but he can be amenable.",5,male
3541,LOKI," What I’m telling you is, you could join me at the Grandmaster’s side. Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then...",5,male
3542,LOKI," You’re not seriously thinking of going back, are you? Our sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass.  She’s stronger than both of us.  She’s stronger than you. You don’t stand a chance. Do you understand what I’m saying to you?",5,male
3543,LOKI, Fine.  I guess I’ll just have to go it alone.  Like I’ve always done. Would you say something?,5,male
3544,LOKI, Say something!,5,male
3545,LOKI, Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?,5,male
3546,LOKI," Odin brought us together, it’s almost poetic that his death should split us apart.  We might as well be strangers now. crown” set adrift.",5,male
3547,LOKI, Though I feel it won’t make much of a difference...,5,male
3548,STRANGE, The preferred term is “Master of the Mystic Arts.”,5,male
3549,STRANGE, My name is Doctor Stephen Strange and I have some questions for you. Take a seat.,5,male
3550,STRANGE, What do you drink?,5,male
3551,STRANGE, So I keep a watch list of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world.  Your adopted brother Loki is one of these beings.,5,male
3552,STRANGE, Then why bring him here?,5,male
3553,STRANGE," So.  If you were to tell you where Odin was, all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard?",5,male
3554,STRANGE," Yeah, do you have a computer?",5,male
3555,STRANGE, I’m just seeing whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications.,5,male
3556,STRANGE, I need just one strand of your hair.,5,male
3557,STRANGE, Don’t forget your umbrella.,5,male
3558,STRANGE, Good luck.,5,male
3559,HELA, So he’s gone? That’s a shame.  I would’ve liked to have seen that.,5,female
3560,HELA," Really, you don’t look like him.",5,female
3561,HELA, You sound like him.,5,female

3564,HELA, I’m Hela.,5,female
3565,HELA, You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts.  How would you like a job?,5,female
3566,HELA, It’s come to my attention that you don’t know who I am.,5,female
3567,HELA, Whoever I am?  Did you listen to a word I said?,5,female
3568,HELA, I thought you’d be happy to see me.,5,female
3569,HELA," Oh, I’ve missed this.  Still, it’s a shame.  Good soldiers dying for nothing...all because they couldn’t see the future.  Sad. Oh!  Look, still alive.",5,female
3570,HELA, Let’s go see my palace.,5,female
3571,HELA, Does no one remember me? Has no one been taught our history? Look at these lies.  Goblets and garden parties?  Peace treaties?,5,female
3572,HELA, Fake.,5,female
3573,HELA," Fenris.  My darling, what have they done to you?",5,female
3574,HELA, What is that noise?,5,female
3575,HELA," Tell me about yourself, Skurge.",5,female
3576,HELA, I’ll just stop you there.  What I meant was what is your ambition?,5,female
3577,HELA," Recognition. When I was young every great King had an executioner.  Not just to execute people, but also to execute their vision.  But mainly to execute people.  Still a great honor. I was Odin’s executioner.",5,female
3578,HELA," Skurge, where’s the sword?",5,female
3579,HELA, You.,5,female
3580,HELA, Well?  Executioner?,5,female
3581,HELA, You’re still alive.,5,female
3582,HELA, It seems our father’s solution to every problem was to cover it up.,5,female
3583,HELA," You see, you never knew him, not at his best. Odin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears. Where do you think all this gold came from? And then one day he decided to become a benevolent king.",5,female
3584,HELA," Okay, get up.  You’re in my seat.",5,female
3585,HELA, But must always be ready for it.,5,female
3586,HELA," To be honest, I expected more.",5,female
3587,HELA," Here’s the difference between us. I’m Odin’s firstborn, the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard. And you’re nothing.",5,female
3588,HELA, You see?  No one’s going anywhere. I’ll get that sword even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it.,5,female
3589,HELA, That little shit.,5,female
3590,HELA," A valiant effort, but you never stood a chance.",5,female
3591,HELA," Tell me brother, what were you the God of again...?",5,female
3592,HELA," Whatever game you’re playing, it won’t work.  You can’t defeat me.",5,female
3593,HELA, No...NO!,5,female
3594,HELA, Kneel.,5,female
3595,HELA," I am Hela, Odin’s first born, Commander of the legions of Asgard, the rightful heir to the throne, and the Goddess of Death.",5,female
3596,HELA," My father is dead.  As are the princes.  You’re welcome. We were once the seat of absolute power in the Cosmos.  Our supremacy was unchallenged, yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.  Our destiny is to rule over all others.  And I am here to restore that power.  Kneel before me...and rise into the ranks of my great conquest.",5,female
3597,HELA, Fine.,5,female
3598,HELA, Change of heart?,5,female
3599,HELA," Odin... proud to have it... ashamed of how he got it. We were unstoppable. I was his weapon in the conquest that built Asgard’s empire. One by one, the realms became ours.",5,female
3600,HELA," But then, simply because my ambition outgrew his...he banished me, caged me, locked me away like an animal.  Before that, Asgard’s warriors were honored, their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very place.",5,female
3601,HELA, Most of the stuff in here is fake.,5,female
3602,HELA, Or weak.,5,female
3603,HELA, Smaller than I thought it would be.,5,female
3604,HELA, That’s not bad? But this... The Eternal Flame.,5,female
3605,HELA, Want to see what true power looks like?,5,female
3606,HELA," With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn!",5,female
3607,HELA, I’ve missed you.  I’ve missed you all.,5,female
3608,HELA, And you will be my executioner. Let’s begin our conquest.,5,female
3609,HELA, That sword is the key to opening the Bi-Frost.,5,female
3610,HELA," These people you mentioned, the ones who aren’t falling into line. Round them up. OMITTED",5,female
3611,HELA, So simple.  Even a blind man could see it.,5,female
3612,HELA, Now you remind me of Dad.,5,female
3613,HELA," You see?  I’m not a queen, or a monster.",5,female
3614,HELA, I’m the Goddess of Death.,5,female
3615,HELA, What were you the God of again?,5,female
3616,GRANDMASTER, He’s wonderful. It is a he?,5,male
3617,GRANDMASTER," Yeah. I love when you come to visit 142, you bring me the best stuff. Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142...what do I always say? “She is the...” and it starts with a B.",5,male
3618,GRANDMASTER," No, not trash.  Were you waiting just to call her that?  It doesn’t start with a “B.”",5,male
3619,GRANDMASTER," I’m so sorry.  No, “best.”  I was thinking about “best.” Because I always say you’re the best.  She brought me my precious beloved Champion, you know.",5,male
3620,GRANDMASTER, What have you brought today?  Tell me.,5,male
3621,GRANDMASTER, I need to go closer.  I want a closer look at this.  Can you take us closer?  Thank you.,5,male
3622,GRANDMASTER, Man.  He is a fighter.,5,male
3623,GRANDMASTER," For heaven’s sake, transfer the units.",5,male
3624,GRANDMASTER, Here’s what I wanna know.  Who are you?,5,male
3625,GRANDMASTER," Wow.  I didn’t hear any thunder, but out of your fingers, was that like...sparkles?",5,male
3626,GRANDMASTER," Oh good! Yeah, come on. I think you’re gonna like this.",5,male
3627,GRANDMASTER, So...,5,male
3628,GRANDMASTER, Carlo... I pardon you.,5,male
3629,GRANDMASTER, You’re officially pardoned...from life.,5,male
3630,GRANDMASTER, I’m stepping in it.  I’m stepping in it.  Look out!,5,male
3631,GRANDMASTER, What does it smell like?,5,male
3632,GRANDMASTER, What happened to my manners?  I haven’t properly introduced myself. Come on.  Follow me.,5,male
3633,GRANDMASTER," Ass-gard? One, two, three, four.",5,male
3634,GRANDMASTER, What are you whispering about?,5,male
3635,GRANDMASTER, Is he any kind of a fighter?,5,male
3636,GRANDMASTER," Now listen to that.  He’s threatening me.  Hey, Sparkles, here’s the deal.  If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg...",5,male
3637,GRANDMASTER," Any contender who defeats my champion, their freedom they shall win.",5,male
3638,GRANDMASTER," That’s what I call, contender! Direction would be this way, Lord.",5,male
3639,GRANDMASTER," Wow!  Look at all of you. What a show, WHAT-A-NIGHT!  Who’s having fun?  Please, I’m your host.  Big round of applause for all of our undercard competitors... who died so gruesomely. Good sports.  What a show! What a night!  This is what you’ve come for and so have I. And now, without further ado... it’s main event time!! Making his first appearance, though he looks quite promising, got a couple of tricks up his sleeve. I’ll say no more, see what you think.  Ladies and gentlemen... I give to you...Lord of Thunder!",5,male
3640,GRANDMASTER," Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going?",5,male
3641,GRANDMASTER, Here we go.,5,male
3642,GRANDMASTER, It seems that that criminally seductive Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.,5,male
3643,GRANDMASTER," I’m upset!  I’m very upset.  You know what I like about being upset? Blame.  Right now, that’s the mindset that I’m in.  And you know who I’m blaming?",5,male
3644,GRANDMASTER, Hey! Don’t interrupt me!,5,male
3645,GRANDMASTER," Why are you handing me the melt stick?  He was interrupting. That’s not a capital violation. My precious champion has come up missing and its all because of that Lord of Thunder.  It’s all because of him. YOUR brother.  Whatever the story is.  Adopted, or complicated.  I’m sure there’s a big history. And YOUR contender.",5,male
3646,GRANDMASTER," You know what?  I woke up this morning thinking about a public execution.  But for now, I’ll settle for this sweet little “who’s gonna get him first?”  So you’re on the clock.",5,male
3647,GRANDMASTER, Revolution?  How did this happen?,5,male
3648,GRANDMASTER, Oh! I don’t like that word!,5,male
3649,GRANDMASTER," No.  Why would I not like “mainframe?”  No, the “S” word.",5,male
3650,GRANDMASTER," Okay, that’s better.",5,male
3651,GRANDMASTER," Loyal Sakaarians, Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship and my favorite champion.  Sakaarians, take to the skies.  Bring him down.  Do not let him leave this planet.",5,male
3652,TOPAZ, Trash.,5,female
3653,TOPAZ, Booze hag.,5,female
3654,TOPAZ, You say that every time she’s here.,5,female
3655,TOPAZ, Tell her she’s dreaming.,5,female
3656,TOPAZ, We located your cousin.,5,female
3657,TOPAZ, Burnt toast.,5,female
3658,TOPAZ, Here you go.,5,female
3659,TOPAZ, Don’t know.  But the Arena’s mainframe for the Obedience Disks have been deactivated and the slaves have armed themselves.,5,female
3660,TOPAZ, Mainframe?,5,female
3661,TOPAZ," Sorry, the “prisoners with jobs” have armed themselves.",5,female
3662,GRANDMASTER, Pay this lady.,5,male
3663,GRANDMASTER," There he is.  Hey, cuz.  We almost couldn’t find you.  What, have you been hiding?",5,male
3664,GRANDMASTER," My name is Grandmaster.  I preside over a little harlequinade called the Contest of Champions.  People come from far and wide to unwillingly participate in it.  And you, my friend, might just be part of the new cast.  What do you say to that?",5,male
3665,GRANDMASTER, Time works real different around these parts.,5,male
3666,GRANDMASTER," On any other world, I’d be like, millions of years old. But here on Sakaar...",5,male
3667,GRANDMASTER," In any case, you know this... You call yourself Lord of Thunder?",5,male
3668,GRANDMASTER, Watch out for his fingers. They make sparks.,5,male
3669,GRANDMASTER," Okay, this is it.  Let’s get ready to welcome this guy. Here he comes. He is a creature.  What can we say about him? Well, he’s unique. There’s none like him.  I feel a special connection with him.",5,male
3670,GRANDMASTER, He’s undefeated.  HE’S THE REIGNING...HE’S THE DEFENDING... Ladies and gentlemen... I give you...,5,male
3671,GRANDMASTER, What?,5,male
3672,GRANDMASTER," Sakaar, hear ye.  Attention please. I have some bad news.  My beloved, exalted Champion has turned up missing.  Take to the streets. Celebrate my champion.",5,male
3673,KORG," Hey!  Take it easy man! Over here.  The pile of rocks waving at you.  Yeah I’m actually a thing, I’m a being.  Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Korg. I’m kind of like the leader in here.  I’m made of rocks, as you can see, but don’t let that intimidate you.  You don’t need to be afraid unless you’re made of scissors. Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you.  This is my very good friend over here, Miek.  He’s an insect and has knives for hands.",5,male
3674,KORG, That I am.,5,male
3675,KORG," Well, I tried to start a revolution but didn’t print enough pamphlets, so hardly anyone turned up.",5,male
3676,KORG," Yeah, no.  This whole thing is a circle.  But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle.",5,male
3677,KORG," No, nothing makes sense here. The only thing that does make sense, is that nothing makes sense.",5,male
3678,KORG," Doug has. Doug! Oh, right, Doug’s dead. That’s right.  Everyone who fights the Grandmaster’s champion perishes.",5,male
3679,KORG," Perishable rocks. There you go. Another one gone. Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights, warm up the crowd and whatnot.  Wait. You’re not gonna face him, are you?",5,male
3680,KORG," That’s exactly what Doug used to say.  See you later, new Doug.",5,male
3681,KORG," Piss off, ghost! He’s freaking gone.",5,male
3682,KORG," Yuck!  There’s Still someone’s hair and blood all over this.  Guys, can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight?  Disgusting slobs. Thor...wanna use a big wooden fork?",5,male
3683,KORG," Yeah, not really useful unless you’re fighting off three vampires that were huddled together.",5,male
3684,KORG, Hammer?,5,male
3685,KORG, You rode a hammer?,5,male
3686,KORG, The hammer rode you on your back?,5,male
3687,KORG, Oh my God.  The hammer pulled you off?,5,male
3688,KORG, Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship wiht this hammer and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.,5,male
3689,KORG," Yeah, Scrapper 142.  She’s strong. And she drinks a lot.",5,male
3690,KORG, Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!,5,male
3691,KORG," Is that some sort of protoplasm, all the stuff that’s coming out of you?  Or are they eggs?  Looks like eggs.",5,male
3692,KORG," Who’s asking?  I know you’re asking. Is anyone else asking, or is it just you?",5,male
3693,KORG, My revolution has begun...,5,male
3694,KORG," There she is.  Our ticket out of here.  Hey, what’s this?",5,male
3695,KORG," Hey man, we’re about to jump on that ginormous spaceship.  You wanna come?",5,male
3696,KORG, Why thank you.,5,male
3697,KORG, Hey man.  I’m Korg.  This is Miek.,5,male
3698,KORG," The damage is not too bad.  As long as the foundations are strong, we can rebuild this place.  It will become a haven for all people and aliens of the universe...",5,male
3699,KORG," Oh, Miek’s dead.  I accidentally stepped on him on the bridge, I’ve just felt so guilty I’ve been carrying him around all day...",5,male
3700,VALKYRIE, And no one escapes this place. So you’re gonna die anyway.,5,female
3701,VALKYRIE, What’s going on?  What do you...?,5,female
3702,VALKYRIE," No, you want to talk to me.",5,female
3703,VALKYRIE, All right. Here’s the deal. I’ll listen to you till this is empty.,5,female
3704,VALKYRIE, Finished. Bye.,5,female
3705,VALKYRIE, If Hela’s back then Asgard is already lost.,5,female
3706,VALKYRIE, Alone?,5,female
3707,VALKYRIE, I think it’s only you.,5,female
3708,VALKYRIE, I’m not getting dragged into another one of Odin’s family squabbles.,5,female
3709,VALKYRIE," Your sister.  Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.",5,female
3710,VALKYRIE, Don’t get familiar.,5,female
3711,VALKYRIE, Forget it.  I have.,5,female
3712,VALKYRIE, Okay.,5,female
3713,VALKYRIE, Great.,5,female
3714,VALKYRIE, For what?,5,female
3715,VALKYRIE, I can do it in two.,5,female
3716,VALKYRIE," I don’t answer to you, lackey.",5,female
3717,VALKYRIE, I don’t help anyone.,5,female
3718,VALKYRIE, Choose your next words wisely.,5,female
3719,VALKYRIE, Hi.,5,female
3720,VALKYRIE," Yeah, well, I did it first.",5,female
3721,VALKYRIE, What are you doing here?  I thought you were leaving.,5,female
3722,VALKYRIE, What’s with the...,5,female
3723,VALKYRIE, But I can see your face.,5,female
3724,VALKYRIE, Who is this guy?,5,female
3725,VALKYRIE, I feel like I know you.,5,female
3726,VALKYRIE," Look, I’ve spent years in a haze trying to forget my past.  Sakaaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day.",5,female
3727,VALKYRIE," I don’t plan to stop drinking, but I don’t want to forget.  I can’t turn away anymore.  So, if I’m donna to die, well... it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag.",5,female
3728,VALKYRIE, Yeah.  So I’m saying that I wanna be on the team. Has it got a name?,5,female
3729,VALKYRIE, Revengers?,5,female
3730,VALKYRIE," Also, I’ve got a peace offering.",5,female
3731,VALKYRIE, It is.,5,female
3732,VALKYRIE, Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems. Our best bet is a wormhole just outside the city limits.,5,female
3733,VALKYRIE, The Devil’s Anus?,5,female
3734,VALKYRIE, We need another ship.  That would tear mine to pieces.,5,female
3735,VALKYRIE," And we need one with cup holders, because we’re gonna die.  So, drinks!",5,female
3736,VALKYRIE," I feel like I know you, too. It’s weird.",5,female
3737,VALKYRIE," There are one or two ships, absolute top-of-the-line models--",5,female
3738,VALKYRIE, And suddenly you’re overcome with an urge to do the right thing.,5,female
3739,VALKYRIE, He did try to kill me.,5,female
3740,VALKYRIE," If we’re boosting a ship, we’re gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace.",5,female
3741,VALKYRIE, You guys have a beast?,5,female
3742,VALKYRIE, Who’s this guy again?,5,female
3743,VALKYRIE, I’m looking for Korg.,5,female
3744,VALKYRIE, The Lord of Thunder sends his best.,5,female
3745,VALKYRIE, I hope that you’re tougher than you look.,5,female
3746,VALKYRIE," Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.",5,female
3747,VALKYRIE, In a minute!,5,female
3748,VALKYRIE," Guys, we’re coming up on the Devil’s Anus!",5,female
3749,VALKYRIE, Here we go!,5,female
3750,VALKYRIE, I never thought I’d be back here.,5,female
3751,VALKYRIE," Here, up here in the mountains.",5,female
3752,VALKYRIE, And get yourself killed?,5,female
3753,VALKYRIE, I’ll take it from here.,5,female
3754,VALKYRIE, “Your majesty.”  Don’t die.  You know what I mean.,5,female
3755,VALKYRIE, This stupid dog won’t die!,5,female
3756,VALKYRIE, What the hell are you talking about?,5,female
3757,VALKYRIE, This isn’t over.,5,female
3758,VALKYRIE, We need to hold her off until everybody’s on board.,5,female
3759,VALKYRIE, What’s our move?,5,female
3760,VALKYRIE, After you.,5,female
3761,VALKYRIE, The people are safe.  That’s all that matters.,5,female
3762,VALKYRIE, I hate this prophecy.,5,female

3843,BANNER, Thank you.,5,male
3844,BANNER, What?,5,male

3857,BANNER," Okay, I’ll give you that.",5,male
3858,BANNER, Tony wears his pants super tight!,5,male
